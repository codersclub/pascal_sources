DESCRIPTION

     "Wierd Stream Tricks" might be a good name for this unit.  It
     contains a miscellaneous collection of objects and procedures, all
     on a theme of adding functionality to the streams in Borland's
     Turbo Pascal libraries TurboVision and ObjectWindows.

     Most of my testing has been in TP 6 and BP 7 real mode; the code
     and demos also appear to work in BP 7 protected mode, and compile
     under Windows, but use it with care in those "foreign"
     environments.


LICENSE

     This unit is *not* public domain code.  You may use it for
     non-profit purposes at no charge if credit is granted, but written
     permission must be obtained from me for use of this unit in

     A lot of the code in this unit is code that's been made freely
     available by others, some of it under their copyright, other parts

     used non-commercially for free.  See the list of credits at the end
     for all the (known) authors.

     This is the third release of the STREAMS unit.  There are probably
     still bugs; I would really appreciate reports of any, or other
     suggestions for improvement.  Please send either one to me at one
     of the following addresses:

Release history and credits

     1.0 - First release, missing LZW.  Immediately replaced by
     1.1 - First correct release: TFilter, TEncryptFilter, TTextFilter,
           TLogFilter, TRAMStream, TNamedBufStream, TTempBufStream,
           TempStream, overlay procedures (my ideas), TLZWFilter
           (from code by Wilbert van Leijen)
     1.2 - TNulStream, TXMSStream added (from Stefan Boether)
           TBitFilter added (suggestion of Rene Seguin)
           TFilter.Done calls Flush
           TRAMStream.UseBuf and OwnMem added.
     1.3 - TDupFilter, TSequential, TChksumFilter added (my ideas),
           TCRC16Filter, TCRCARCFilter, TCRC32Filter and related procedures
           added (from code by Edwin T. Floyd, Stephen Satchell, Chuck
           Forsberg, Mark G. Mendel, R. P. Byrne, J. R. Louvau and
           probably others); TFilter.Flush added; HUFFMAN demo added.
     1.4 - Recoded several of the TRAMStream methods in assembler for
           more speed; fixed numerous TTextFilter bugs and added
           TTextFilter.AssignStream and TextDemo.pas; fixed
           TXMSStream.Seek bug.  Changed xms_Memavail and xms_Maxavail
           to report in bytes, and added ems_Memavail and ems_Maxavail
           (based on code sent to me by Eyal Doron) and disk_Memavail
           and disk_Maxavail. Changed TXMSStream.Init to match
           TEMSStream.Init. Added TConcatFilter, TLimitFilter,
           TLoopFilter, TReverseFilter and TWorkStream.  Added OwnsBase
           field to TFilter.  Did some testing to assure that the unit
           works in BP 7 protected mode.  Thanks to Max Maschein, Eyal
           Doron, and others for bug fix help.
     1.5 - The first public release of the 1.4 enhancements.</PRE>
