               Pascal 6.0

    Usage:  Run MOUSEFIX after loading your mouse driver, before running
            the TP6 IDE. It's a 27K TSR; if it works, you'll probably
            want to rewrite it in assembler.

    A lot of people have had trouble with TP 6 losing their mouse
    cursor. I didn't have this problem, until I started using the IDE
    within Desqview: then using Alt-F5 to view the output screen, and
    Enter to get back to the editor would confuse Desqview, so that the
    next time I popped up the Desqview menu and got rid of it my mouse
    cursor would be lost.

    I recently got a copy of Schulman et al's Undocumented DOS (great
    book!) and the program Intrspy included with it, so I tried spying
    on the mouse interrupt to see what was going on. It looks as though
    the offending code goes something like this:

      ( You hit Alt-F5 )
      TP saves the mouse state
      TP turns off the mouse cursor
      ( You hit enter to get back to the editor )
      TP restores the mouse state.

    TP seems to assume that restoring the mouse state will restore the
    cursor, and it does: but Desqview doesn't know that it does, so it
    thinks the cursor is still hidden.

    I'd guess that similar problems happen with incompatible mouse
    drivers: they don't restore the cursor when the state gets restored.

    If that's true, then the program MOUSEFIX might fix it. What it does
    is to keep track of the cursor status between saves & restores, and
    enforce a balance of shows and hides. It seems to fix the problems
    within Desqview, so I'm hopeful it'll work elsewhere, too.

    I wrote it in TP using Object Professional's OPINT and OPTSR units
    for clarity; if you want to really use the thing, you'll probably
    want to rewrite it in as
