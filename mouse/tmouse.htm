Introduction
------------
   These routines are being distributed as an aid to the development of
Turbo Pascal programs using the Microsoft mouse.  The mouse comes with a
program that is accessed via BASIC but it is not accessable from Turbo Pascal.


Included Files
-------- -----
   There are two files making up Turbo Mouse version 2.1.

          TMOUSE.DOC    Documentation.

          TMOUSE.PAS    This file contains the functions and procedures making
                        up Turbo Mouse.  In order to use it you must include
                        it before your programs code. Uses TMOUSE; is fine.

          TMOUSE.TPU    This is the unit file already compiled.
