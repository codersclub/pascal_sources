             Save the Earth from the hideous terror in the skies!
          Fight off the evil alien claim-jumpers from Alpo Centurian!


Space Investors was designed to enable almost anybody to achieve an  "arcade-
game high" -- that  glassy-eyed  state of  utter  concentration in which your
hands fly with an apparent will of their own, while your very existence seems
to depend upon the destruction of just ... one ... more ... alien!!!

Now, that particular state of mind may or may not be a good thing,  but it IS
a great way to burn off (ZAP!) your frustrations (POW!) and your basic desire
(BOOM!) to bash something into smithereens.

Here's the trick:  Space Investors builds up the speed  SLOWLY.   This may be
a little dull for  seasoned monster-mashers,  but it does give mere mortals a
chance to "get into" the game  before they're destroyed.



STRATEGY TIPS
-------------

WARNING!  Some game secrets are revealed,  here!   Maybe you'd prefer to find
--------  them out for yourself?  If you'd like the challenge,  skip the rest
          of this article.

Each ship has a  different personality  and moves in a  different way.   Here
are some aspects of their battle-plan:

THE MOTHERSHIP is as fast as YOU are,  so you can't  chase it.   What's more,
as your score gets higher,  it drops "smart" bombs that chase after you.  And
as time goes on,  you'll notice that it tends to back up for  another try, if
it missed you the first time.  (This can work AGAINST it, too!)

THE BATTLE-POD also has smart bombs.

If the ship that dropped a  smart-bomb  is destroyed,  or  leaves the screen,
the bomb loses its "chase" capability.

THE OBSERVER seldom drops bombs, but he keeps  FOLLOWING YOU AROUND!   What's
more, he's tiny ... and he moves at FIVE TIMES your speed!  Leave him alone.

As your score gets higher,  the games gets faster, the bombs get smarter, and
the ships become more  devious.   For example,  a ship can "jump over" one of
your missiles by  changing levels.  As your score increases,  you'll see this
happening more frequently.

You get new shield-boxes for every 1000 points you score.

The designer of this game has never scored more than  8000 points.  Mind you,
he's a lousey video-gamer.

By the way,  the keyboard layout  was designed to be  comfortable  for touch-
typists.  It may prove to be easier for you than the usual arrow-keys method.</PRE>
