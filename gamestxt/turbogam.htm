AMAZING.PAS
    Build and moving the maze (labirint).

ARTILLRY.PAS
    This is a typical cannon shooting game.  You pick an angle to
    fire the cannon at and,  if you get close enough, you hit the
    enemy.

BACCARAT.PAS
    Baccarat  is  a  card game popular in Europe.  It is  a  high
    stakes gambling game favored by the rich (us poor types can't
    afford it).  The player and the bank get two cards each. Tens
    and  face cards count 0,  number cards count their value  and
    aces  count  one.  Each  player totals his  cards  modulo  10
    (anything over 10 is dropped) and the higher total  wins.  An
    additional card may be added if desired. A total of 8 or 9 on
    the  initial  two  cards  is  called  a  "NATURAL"  and  wins
    immediately.  An example of counting; dealt an ace and a six,
    the  player has a total of seven;  dealt a jack and a  three,
    the  player has a total of three;  dealt a five and an eight,
    the player has a total of three (thirteen minus ten).

BJGAME.PAS
    This is the time honored game of blackjack.  This is a pretty
    rudimentary  version  of the game as splitting  and  doubling
    down are not allowed.  Blackjacks are honored,  but pay  only
    even money. Blackjack pushes are won by the house. The dealer
    plays  on even if you bust and thus can also bust.  This is a
    push (no bet).

BLACKBOX.PAS
    This  a game to guess where a hidden object (or objects)  are
    in  a black box.  You do this by shooting balls into the  box
    and  observing  where  they exit  (if  they  exit).  This  is
    affected by the way the ball enetering approaches the waiting
    object.  If  it  hits head on,  the ball is absorbed,  if  it
    passed between two objects separated by one space,  the  ball
    is  reflected  back to the source,  if it is adjacent  to  an
    object on the edge, the ball is reflected back to the source,
    if  it is diagonal to an object,  the ball is reflected at  a
    right angle to the original path.

BLOCK.PAS
    This is a block letter producer.

BOGGLE.PAS
    This  is a version of the ever popular number  guessing  game
    mastermind.

CHUCKLCK.PAS
    This  is a dice rolling game.  You pick a number and bet that
    at least one of three dice rolled will be that number.

CRIBBAGE.PAS
    WELCOME TO KIDDIE KRIBBAGE!
    Adapted from "Cribbage" in APPLE PASCAL GAMES,
    by Douglas Hergert and Joseph T. Kalash,
    pages 301-349.  Sybex, 1981.
    TURBO Pascal 1.0, Copyright 1983 by Borland Int. 1/17/84 DCO
    It''s you against me, kid!
    Whoever pegs 121 points first wins!

DODGE.PAS
    This  is a dodge'em type game where you are being pursued  by
    various  meanies  and  your  object  is  to  avoid  them   or
    preferrably destroy them.

GUESSIT.PAS
    This  is the simpliest game,  guessing a number between 1 and
    100. You are told if you are high or low.

HANGMAN.PAS
    This a typical hangman program.  It has a list of words  (see
    MAKEFILE.PAS),  selects one and then you guess the letters in
    the word,  with seven incorrect guesses causing the man to be
    hanged.

HORSERAC.PAS
    This  is  a rather complicated horse race game.  A series  of
    twelve  horses  start the race.  Each horse has  a  different
    handicap which is a distance to run.  Two dice are rolled and
    the  horse represented by the total of the dice may be  moved
    one  length,  or  the horses represented by each die  may  be
    moved one length.

KENO.PAS
    This  is a version of the Las Vegas gambling game  KENO.  You
    are  allowed to choose 8 numbers from 1 to 80.  The  computer
    will  select 20 numbers in the same range.  You win based  on
    how many of your numbers the computer also selected.

KISMET.PAS
    This game is very similar to Yahtzee. Variations are added by
    the introduction of color on the dice and an extra roll.  The
    game ends after six turns by each player.

LANDER.PAS
    This a game where you try to land on a planet.  The planet is
    unspecified and changes each game.  Thus the gravity changes,
    as  well as fuel supplies,  speed,  and starting  height.  In
    addition  there are meteor swarms to contend with.  The  file
    LANDINST.DAT contains instructions for this game.

LANDINST.DAT
    The instructions for LANDER.PAS.

LIFE.PAS
    LIFE simulates the growth of a colony of animalcules in a
    square World.
    Whether a cell is born, lives or dies depends on the number
    of living animalcules near by.  If a cell is empty and has
    exactly 3 neighbors, it will be born in the next generation.
    If it is alive and has 2 or 3 neighbors, it will stay alive.
    Otherwise, it either dies of loneliness or suffocates from
    overcrowding.

    You type in the starting pattern, giving the XY location of
    each cell.  When you enter X Y be sure to leave a SPACE
    between the numbers.  When you are through seeding a colony,
    enter a -1 to begin the generations.  The &lt; key speeds things
    up a bit, the &gt; key slows things down.  In the good old days
    at M.I.T., this game was played with pencil & graph paper.

MAKEFILE.PAS
    This  is the program to create the word file for HANGMAN.PAS.
    It  must be run to create a word file before HANGMAN  can  be
    used.

NUMCNVRT.PAS
    This  program  lets you practice converting numbers from  one
    base to another.

OVERUNDR.PAS
    This is a dice betting game.  You pick a number from 2 to  12
    and roll two dice.  You win (four to one) if the roll matches
    the  number picked,  or (even money) if both the bet and  the
    roll are over or under seven.

PASCAL.PAS
    This program prints out Pascal triangles.

PLIFE.PAS
     This is a version of LIFE,  the classic computer  game.  You
    enter the coordinates of each starting cell until the initial
    pattern  is set.  You can erase a set cell by re-entering the
    cell's  coordinates.  Setting coordinates outside  the  basic
    colony will end the input phase.  The colony will cycle until
    one  of three things happen;  1) the colony dies out,  2) the
    colony stabilizes (no births or deaths),  or 3) a key on  the
    keyboard is pressed.

SNAKE.PAS
    In  this game,  you try to get the treasure before the  snake
    roaming the screen can get you. The snake will ignore you for
    a while,  but will get REAL interested as you build up a cash
    supply.  Your object is to get the cash and get out the door.
    Use the U, N, H, and J keys to go up, down, left and right.

TELEPHON.PAS
    This  program  generates  letter patterns  out  of  telephone
    numbers.

TWINKLE.PAS
    This  program fills the screen with stars then erases them in
    interesting patterns.

WUMPUS.PAS
    This is a typical game of Hunt the Wumpus.</PRE>
