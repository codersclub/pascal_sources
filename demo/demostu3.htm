Hi again,
a year has passed since I last managed to turn on my old computer at
home and tap in some more code...

-------------------------

Have you ever seen one of those cool demos with vector worlds,
gouraud and phong shading, texturemapping and so on? Probably you
have! And you think: "They're cool" - and they are.
But it's hard figuring out what's really done and what it takes to
make something like it.

So here my code for flat, gouraud and environment shading.
I dug up my gouraud code from last year (DEMOSTU2.ZIP) which I
thought to be no good - it turned out that with a few modifications,
it could produce really nice shadings!

                <img border=0 width=320 height=200 src="demost31.jpg" alt="">

It reads Autodesk 3D Studio objects! Create your own objects in 3DS
and render them real-time with this piece of code!!!!
Be aware that this is my first attempt to make something like this.
Parts of the code is really slow (such as the polygon drawer) but it
does seem to work. I'm not a hot-shot demo coder. Havn't done a
single PC demo in my whole life - and I'm not trying to. I'm no
math wiz-kid either, most of the formulas are from documents
from x2ftp.oulu.fi regarding shading or tampered from other
peoples code :)
I have included a few 3DS objects for display. You'll be pleased
to see the awfull duck is here again.

Files to look for:
  READ3DS.PAS
  GOURAUD1.PAS
  GOURAUD2.PAS
  ENVIRON1.PAS

Did you ever wish that it was YOU who could play dashing FLIC
animations for your friends. Well, you can now. I got so tired of the
usual net commercials "Buy this software pack for only $XXX,
and get a super FLIC library". Why not code it yourself...

These sources allow you to read and display:

 pcx,pcc,lbm,iff,pic,tga,bmp,rle,cel,gif,tiff,anm,fli,flc,dl,3ds,avi

files.
The sources were made to MY needs and does not support all modes!
Images are only supported at 320x200x256 and most files cannot be
larger than 64K!?!! Some of the formats are only supported with a
limited compression selection. But it should give you a pretty good
idea of what goes on and give you something to work on to match your
needs.
I have included code to play FLIs and FLCs, Deluxe Paint ][ .ANM files,
AVI and .DL animations too. Soon to be followed by QuickTime.

Files to look for:
  TESTFLI.PAS
  TESTANM.PAS

and a bunch of units for reading each format.

To get all this working: use Borland Pascal 7.0, put off all
stack/range checking, put on +286 code and compile.
The democode requires a 386, but assumes something faster with
co-processor.
Since this file contains updates to DEMOSTUF.ZIP and DEMOSTU2.ZIP,
please unzip this file after all others.

I havn't really time for this. It's funny to see cool demos on the
PC thinking back on the good ol' Amiga days. Sniff, I get all
sentimental. Hope some of your guys out the can use this for
anything.

Well, that's it...
