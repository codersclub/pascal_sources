Hey look what a mess this is! =)

I've decided to release this, a year after I coded it.
After all some dudes are still interested in how to do
Copper effects (well I'm not any longer, but who cares :)
and this intro contains alot of them.
Some are quite easy while some are combinations and quite difficult
to guess how I did them coz I don't comment non-commercial code...
If you have problems, check out a VGA manual what all those regs do.
There's a vga.txt with a brief explanation available on internet -
I found it in Robert Schmidt's tweak110.zip or whatever the current
version is.
If you dont have access to this file, look it up in the Ferraro
EGA/VGA book, any version.

DO NOT EVER BUG ME ABOUT THIS :-)

Some of the procedures must really suck, they're out of the 80's -
in fact I don't use any of the source still,
nor will I in the future - and this was the only reason
to release them.
If you make anything nice and/or valuable with it, don't feel like
you MUST credit me ;)

Some closing words concerning Copper Faked:

You'll find it hard to do design and music with copper effects,
since you'll have to have access every rasterline, that's approx.
30.000 per second.
No time to execute a player
(except maybe GUS but I didn't have one then),
no time to do alot of memory movements :(

Thanks go to the (surprisingly many) dudes who voted for this at The
Party '93 although the (amiga? pc?) organizers broke it almost after
the beginning with hitting ESCAPE for next part which ended it -
a mistake I realize ... no one of my future demos will check for ANY
keyboard input.
This could of course have been avoided if the organizers had run it
before AND noticed. Well, Lord Cyrix had nothing to say against it
("I was not there"), so fuck him and lame excuse for lacking
responsibility.

I hope The Party it will be better this year!
Meet me, I'm the guy with the long hair at the Surprise! Productions
table.

You can't - I have no account, nowhere, due to some denunciating
