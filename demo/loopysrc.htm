Hi, welcome to the source release of stoopeekefeeloopee or
whatever you wanna call it.

Por cierto, muchas gracias a Cesar Vellido por su TMT Sound
System. Desde que encontre el TMT Pascal habia estado buscando
un Mod-Player que soportara SoundBlaster y no habia encontrado
nada. Apenas encontre el TSS, ya estaba pensando en hacer este
demo.

I made this demo just for fun and because I wanted to do
something cool with TMT Pascal. The result might not be very
impressive, but I didn't want it to be. I had a lot of fun
coding it and showing it to my friends and that's all I wanted.


I didn't include a compiled version for some reasons:

        1) The ZIP file would have to be about 100 Kb bigger.

        2) There's really no need to include the EXE because the
           compilation process is very simple.

        3) If you want the EXE, then you can download the
           compiled demo from www.hornet.org , just search for
           F_LOOPY.ZIP



Disclaimer and that kind of stuff:
----------------------------------

  This code worked fine in my computer and in a dozen other
  computers and it should work fine in your computer. If it
  doesn't, it's not my fault. The code is not dangerous.

  Even though this demo is not some great stuff, you might find
  something useful in it. If you do, I'd like to know it. If you
  like or use any part of the code, it would be nice to credit
  me and/or e-mail me.


How to compile:
---------------

  The demo was coded using the registered version of TMT Pascal
  v2.0, and it has been compiled with the unregistered version
  too, and I'm sure that it should work with older versions,
  like 1.2 and 1.3.

  The main source file is KEFFY.PAS so you only have to type
  something like:

                PLT KEFFY

            or  PLTPMW KEFFY    (this is the one I prefer)

  to compile the demo. BUT IF you don't have the registered
  version of TMT OR IF you dont have a SoundBlaster compatible
  soundcard, THEN you have to make a little modification to the
  source. Just uncomment the line that says {$define NoMusic}
  and compile the same way as above.

  This is because the sound player ONLY works with the
  registered compiler and only supports SoundBlaster cards.
  Furthermore, I think the sound player ONLY works with the
  registered versions 2.0 and above.

  After that, you should be able to enjoy this little piece of
  art.



About the demo:
---------------

  The demo uses just a few simple effects: simple 3D stuff, flat
  shading, simple texture mapping, plasma, wobblers, text
  scrollie, scaling and blurring.

  Basically, the demo is a text scroller with some pictures, a
  cool cube and some changing backgrounds. And it looks really
  nice :)

  It was made in about 8 hours, in two afternoons. I started
  with the music and some gfx then the main part code and the
  background effects, and finally the intro and ending parts.
  The demo was coded and runs fine in a Windows 95 DOS box.

  There's not too much optimizing there. I didn't have much time
  and I really didn't cared about making such a simple thing
  fast. I get more than 40 fps in my AMD K6 166Mhz in Windows
  95. I used some asm for the critic stuff but most of the code
  is in Pascal.



About the code:
---------------

  Well, I told you it's not too fast, but worse than that, some
  units are really ugly. Some parts of the code use too many
  globals and have lots of patches here and there. I tried to
  put some comments for this release but there's still some
  uncommented stuff. Don't e-mail me about that. This is all I
  will give you. I know it's a pain in the ass trying to
  decipher somebody else's code, but I won't give you everything
  already chewed. The code should be easy enough to understand
  now.

  The text in TEXT.TXT can be modified using an hexadecimal
  editor. The text should only contain lowercase letters,
  numbers, spaces and some other symbols. Take a look at
  CHARSET.PCX to see what chars are accepted.

  Of course you could modify the pictures and the text and the
  source and recompile the demo and say that you made it, but
  only a few people are stupid and lamer enough to do that.



Greetings:
----------

  Thanks to Cesar Vellido / CiMedia for the mod-player
  Thanks to Matt Byggmaster aka MRI / Doomsday  for the FATMAP
         document
  Thanks to TMT for their pascal compiler
         (I don't regret buying it)
  Thanks to whoever draw that picture of storm
  Thanks to Angela Basset who accepted posing for my demo :)
