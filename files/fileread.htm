INTRODUCTION

     The FileRead programmer's library is a set of tools that allow you,
the programmer, to open and manipulate a data file with any data type
you choose.  It's fully object oriented and extensible so using this
database is as easy as declaring an instance of the TFread object,
initializing the file, then manipulating the data.


REQUIREMENTS

     This toolkit requires Turbo Pascal 6.0 and will work on anything
that Turbo Pascal 6.0 will work on, including my lowly tandy 1000 SX,
the computer on which I designed FileRead.

FILES

     You should have the following files in your distribution disk or
archive:

     Fileread.Pas........The fileread library source code
     Fileread.Tpu........The fileread library Tpu version 6 format
     Fileread.Txt........This documentation
     Test.Pas............Test #1 source code
     Test2.Pas...........Test #2 source code
     L.Exe...............File listing program
     Readme.Bat..........Batch file to launch file viewer
     Register.Doc........Registration form to be filled out and sent in


ENDING NOTES

     This is merely the first version of this software library, and no
attempts to include internal buffering have been attempted.  I am
planning with future releases to have some kind of internal buffering
that might make the file accessing faster.  Since this is an object,
however, you could take it upon yourself to write your own object which
would inherit mine and add your own buffering handler.
