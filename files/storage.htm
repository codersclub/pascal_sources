     This Unit was designed to allow you the user to save and restore
     several bodies of text or information into a single file and restore
     that information based on a single LONGINT.  Examples of usage are:

        In a BBS system where you are creating a message base and need to
        save several messages however do not want to create several files.
        You also want the messages compressed to save disk space

        In a program where you are storing variable length records that you
        want to keep track of in an indexed database.  Your index key can
        use the LONGINT returned by the storage system as your reference
        into the record.  The record will be stored in compressed format.

     I'm sure that people can think of all kinds of neat things to do with
     this system.  The main advantage that you have with this object is
     that ANY kind of data can be stored {Length: 0 &lt; sizeof(data) &lt; 65530}
     as long as it fits in the buffer space.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  These routines were originally designed as a message storage routine for a
  new BBS system message base that we are putting together, however we have
  used this storage format for a varity of purposes as you can store variable
  length messages to one file and only have to keep track of an index.  It
  also attempts to save on disk space which is ALWAYS at a premium around
  here.

  would just like to chat, you can reach me at the following:
