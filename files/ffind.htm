 DESCRIPTION

 FFIND is a file finder program much like FF found in the Norton
 Utilities Advanced Edition.

 FFIND can be used to find all files on a drive matching a
 particular filespec. Wildcard file specifications are fully
 supported.

 FFIND is very helpful when you may have 'lost' a file, or
 when you'd like to determine whether you may have files with
 duplicate names scattered across your disk.

 Note that FFIND lists the volume label and directory entries
 in UPPER case, while other entries are listed in lower
 case. This is especially helpful when using the wide (/W)
 listing option.

 The output of FFIND can be redirected to a device or printer
 (e.g. LPT1: or fname.ext)

 Execution can be terminated at any time by hitting the Esc
 (Escape) key, Ctrl-Break, or Ctrl-C.

 FFIND can be renamed to any valid DOS name (e.g.
 you could rename FFIND.EXE to FS.EXE); under DOS 3.0
 or later, the copyright and help screens will
 reflect the new name of the program.


 USAGE


 FFIND [d:] [filespec] [switches]

       [d:]       is the drive to search; if this is not
                  specified, the default drive is used

       [filespec] is optional; if omitted, *.* is used


 SWITCHES:

       /W  Wide format

           if /W is specified, file sizes and dates are omitted,
           and only the file names are listed in a 5 file per
           line format.


       /O  Omit directories

           This can be especially useful when using a filespec of
           *. or *.* . It produces a more compact listing when
           you are interested only in files, and not
           subdirectories, which happen to match the filespec.


       /P  Pause Mode

           Pauses and prompts for a keypress after each page
           of output.

           Whether or not the /P option is specified FFIND
           output can be interrupted at any time by pressing any
           key.


       /H  Help

           Produces a screen explaining FFIND syntax

 RELEASE HISTORY

  1.1    first general release

  1.4    corrected Pause message to always appear in column 1
         when /W format specified

         allow '- ' to delimit parameters as well as '/'

         discard . and .. as ignored filespecs, rather
         than halt with an error

         added the drive letter to line indicating the filespec
         used for search.

  1.5P   corrected truncation of filename.ext when filespec is
         greater than 13 characters long

         Suffix added to distinguish version of program written
         in Pascal (P) from that written in C (C)

  Interim 'releases' have involved optimization of source code
  only.


  SOURCE CODE

  Source Code for FFIND can be found in the Borland (TP5)
  data library on Compuserve, and on Canada Remote Systems.

  Note:

    Under DOS 3.00 or later, the executable FFIND program can
    be renamed, and the copyright and help screens will
    reflect the new name.

    This has a harmless side-effect; programmers RUNning FFIND
    from the TurboPascal development environment will find
    that FFIND refers to itself as TURBO. (Try it!)

    The same program compiled to disk will reflect the correct
    program name when executed from the DOS command line, even
    when using the TurboPascal DOS Shell.


 A Turbo C Version Soon Available

 A functional identical version of this program has been
 written in C and is currently undergoing beta-test. The
 source code will be released to the Compuserve Turbo C forum
 (and other BBS's) as soon as it is available.</PRE>
