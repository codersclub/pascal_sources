The following should be noted:

Pictures may not be displayed on buttons yet.  Make sure you pass
the button procedures NIL for any picture information.

The BGI PGUI mouse driver Hot Spots do not work yet, make sure you
pass the procedures 0 for the X and Y hot spots.

Fill in your BGI path in the two example files, TESTPGUI.PAS
and PGUI-EG.PAS before compiling the files.

TESTPGUI is a better example where you can grab the window with
the mouse and drag it around the screen (grab the window heading
by holding the mouse button while pressing on the heading).

If you want large windows (&gt;64 kb), you will need the super VGA
BGI drivers and DOSMEM (PSDSM) to get blocks larger than 64 kb
from the heap.

Requirements:

- Turbo Pascal 6

- EGA, VGA or Super VGA

- Pure Power Units: Strings (v1.02)                     [Not Included],

                    Icons,
                    BGI PGUI Mouse Driver

  These units should be available at the same site / BBS that you found this

You can make nice looking programs quickly.  Save yourself weeks of
programming by using units available on the public domain and units
available as shareware.  Today so many fine programmers are releasing
their source code for the benefit of software in general.  Make use
of this.
