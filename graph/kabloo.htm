Kablooie is a pseudo-programmable fireworks simulator that works on an IBM
AT or better with MCGA/VGA/SVGA.  In order to use the high-resolution SVGA
modes Kablooie requires a VESA-compatible SVGA system or the appropriate
VESA TSR loaded.

To start Kablooie type "kablooie" from the DOS prompt.  It will display
an introductory screen and inform you of the video mode selection you
may make on the command line.  After pressing &lt;return&gt; you should see
a fireworks display.  If not, check the video mode table and see if it's
picking an impossible mode for your adapter as default (it sometimes
does this).  If so, pick a more likely mode to work and start with that
as instructed.

When you get tired of watching the fireworks I have created you may make
your own.  This is done by editing the "kablooie.kab" file, which must
be in the current directory when kablooie is run.  This file consists
of the descriptions of the various kinds of firework that will be launched.
Note that any blank line or line that begins with a space is a comment
and will be ignored by kablooie.

The file consists of a number of entries, each beginning with "firework"
or "packing" and ending with "end."  All keywords must be on an otherwise
blank line.  Kablooie will pick an entry from among those designated
"firework"s at launch time.  Those starting with "packing" must be started
as part of a "firework."  "Firework"s may also contain other "firework"s,
but "packing"s will not be launched independently.

The next line after "firework" or "packing" is the name.  This should be
unique and may be any string up to thirty chars long.  After thirty chars
the name will be truncated.  It will be used to refer to the entry later,
as part of another entry.

The line after the name is either "noflash" or "flash."  This line
determines whether, when this particular firework (or piece of one)
terminates (completes, fades out), it will flash the screen or not.
Sparks that just fade out and do nothing should not flash; however,
it is recommended that fireworks which will explode and launch others
should flash the screen.

On the next line after "flash" or "noflash" is the color of the firework.
This must be "red," "blue," "green," or "yellow."  This determines (can you
guess?) the color of the firework as it travels through the "air."

After that (yet another line down) comes the longevity of the firework.
This is measured in simulation-clock ticks; 10 is almost instant death (with
possible explosion), 200 allows a launched firework to travel a graceful
arc before releasing its contents.

The next line is the gravitational pull.  Usually this ought to be three,
however, you may want to change this value to suit your needs.  The higher
the number, the faster the firework will fall.

If the firework will not release anything-like, say, a spark-the next line
should be "end," and another "firework" or "packing" would come after that.
If, however, you want it to explode and shoot off other fireworks, you will
now list those before the "end."

If that is the case, then the next line will be the name of the first
firework (usually a packing, actually) that will be launched.  This is the
name you specified after "packing" or "firework" when originally describing
the sub-firework; its entry must precede the entry of the firework containing
it.  (Kablooie _will_ allow recursive fireworks which launch more of them-
selves, but this is not recommended.)

The next line in the sub-launch description is the average number of
fireworks of that type you want launched.  If you are launching sparks,
one hundred to three hundred makes a nice chrysanthemum; if you are launching
fireworks which will themselves launch other things, keep the number low
or else you may slow down the simulator with a large number of flying
objects.

The line after that is the maximum random variation from the average number.
zero will allow no variation; there will always be as many fireworks launched
from the explosion as you specify.

After that, on the next line, is the strength with which the sub-fireworks
will be launched.  Five fairly propels them across the screen; one keeps them
in a tight little bunch; and zero will cause any launched fireworks to follow
"in the footsteps" of the (now defunct) launching firework.

After that will either be "end," if there are no more kinds of firework to
be launched upon termination, or the name of another sub-firework if not,
followed by the relevant data, and so on until finally there will be an
"end."  The last non-comment line in the file should be "end."  (Without the
period.)

This is all very confusing, I know.  To get the hang of it, look at the
included kablooie.kab file; it has some comments explaining what is what.

Kablooie is in the public domain.  Do what you want with it.

Files in the ZIP should be:

kablooie.exe - the main .exe file (run it!)
kablooie.doc - this file
kablooie.kab - the included firework definition file

kablooie.pas - main source file (TP 6.0)
colour.pas   - MCGA/VGA+ color handler unit
bgi256.obj   - MCGA/VGA/VESA graphics driver by Michael Day
bgi256.pas   - TP unit which links in the graphics driver</PRE>
