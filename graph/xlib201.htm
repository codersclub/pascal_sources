  Hi Xlib users, this is v2.0 of my port of XLib to Turbo/Borland Pascal.
  I would like to state a few things before you start using this package :

  XLIB 2.0 is NOT complete. I would have liked to add more things before
  releasing this, but the end of my 2nd year here at Sussex University is
  coming to an end, and I'm in the middle of my exams. Then I will go home
  to Italy, and won't have Internet access until I come back in October.

  I wanted to get this finished, including rotation and the such, but, alas,
  I haven't found the time. In line with these considerations I want you to
  think this as a BETA.

  I have ported all the useful stuff from Xlib for C v6.0, and added a few
  things of my own, apart from cleaning up the code and making it more
  Pascal-friendly.

  If there is any code you have written that you think is worth including in
  the next release, don't hesitate to send it to me and you will receive due
  credit.

  Sorry if this isn't up to your expectations but, hey, don't forget : XLIB
  is a user supported library, so send me your code and let's write the
  ultimate XMode game !!!

  Share and enjoy.

  The SplitScreen routines weren't handled by the Virtual VSync handler,
  sometime resulting in the program waiting twice for a vsync, and causing
  a choppy effect when scrolling the split screen.
  Now the mouse handler uses the VVH to redraw the pointer
  when necessary. Unfortunately it takes a bit too long and, if you are
  updating the whole palette AND using the mouse at the same time, you'll
  notice that the tip of the pointer disappears for an instant when it's at
  the top of the screen.
  The palette-updating part of the VVH has been sped up a bit.

  I have implemented 32-bit compiled bitmaps, even though they are bigger and
  (on my machine) slightly slower than normal CBMs. Maybe on VLB/PCI machines
  this isn't the case.

  Protected mode is still at an experimental stage, but it can do quite a few
  things already.
  Things that don't work in protected mode are :

  - The Virtual VSync handler (self-modification works, but the rest doesn't)
  - VBM's on my machine are faster in pmode (??!?!?!)
  - I assume that the ROM font is at segment 0C000h because that's where the
      Video BIOS usually is. I have tested it on a Paradise (WD90c30), a
      Cirrus Logic (CL-54xx) and a Trident (9000i) with no problems. If you
      find some board that doesn't work please report it (though I don't know
      why you'd want to use ROM BIOS fonts anyway :-)
  - The palette scrolling in the XLIBDEMO is tooooooo slow...

  If you find a way of fixing these, or if you find more routines that don't
  like protected mode, email me please.

Release v2.01

  XConvert was broken. Fixed.
  XLArc and XLA2 were broken in DPMI. Fixed.
  Added file viewing in XLArc.
  If you want to know how to do CBMs in DPMI, read BLITDEMO.PAS.
  Makefile fixed.
  Bugfixes here and there.

  A good idea for debugging programs that use XLib is to use Colin Buckley's
  UNCHAIN v2.1 program. The code for saving the screen information is built
  in the xsetmode function, but if you don't use UNCHAIN it should not make
  any difference.

| APPLICATIONS THAT USE XLIB FOR TP/BP                                      |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  I have decided to start a list of applications that have been written using
  a version of XLibPas, and where they can be found. Please mail me any
  additions.
