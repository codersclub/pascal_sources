Notes For Turbo Pascal

	The GETADD, INKEY and ST2BIN functions are not implemented in
turbo pascal.  The Turbo "ofs() and seg()" functions should be used to
determine the address of an item in place of the GETADD function.  Since
Turbo allows hex notation in the language, it should be used instead of
ST2BIN.  Turbo also provides functions for getting keyboard characters
so INKEY is not needed.

Notes For MS FORTRAN

	MS Fortran now has type checking.  This is helps prevent programming
errors, but causes compiler errors when a routine can accept variables
of different data types.  When calling the assembly language routines
errors F3606 and F3607 may be generated.  If they are, and you know what
you are doing is correct, ignore the errors. The correct code will be
generated.  If FORTRAN is going to do type checking then it should also
have type casting !  Oh well, some day....


Notes For MS QuickBasic

	The functions GETADD, INKEY, and ST2BIN were not intended for
use with BASIC; so there are no BASIC examples for these functions.
	When using the LDFONT routine there is one difference for BASIC:
the user does not allocate the space for the font to be loaded.  The LDFONT
routine allocates the space and returns an offset and segment to the space.
Please review the example program provided BLDFONT.BAS.
	XFRVDT is an assembly routine and is called differently than
the other toolkit functions.  Again please review the example program
BXFRVDT.BAS


Toolkit General Notes:

	We have tried very hard to test and proof the documentation and
software for v3.0.  If you do however happen to find any typographical
errors or any other problems, please feel free to notify us by mail
or phone.  We are always interested in our customers comments and opinions.
