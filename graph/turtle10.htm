Why did I wrote that unit ?

    Do you remember that little turtle with a pen at the tail
that was the main feature of the Logo language ? A toy to
learn computers to kids ??? Well not so...

    For my fellow teachers in C.S., turtle graphics are an
exellent introduction to recursion , with  quite attractive
visual effects. Drawing "dragon curves " (Von Koch snowflake,
Peano's curves...) is so natural with this little friendly
animal....

    Another application is in the representation of 2D shapes
by relative motions of the turtle  ; that by a couple (
distance, angle ) from a previous point.  This makes the
manipulation of the shape much easier than with the standard
cartesian coordinates representation.  A translation just
requires changing the starting point of the drawing ;
rotations can be obtained by changing the turtle heading and
zooming is done by changing the pixel/distance ratio for the
turtle motions.  Nearly no trigonometric calculations are
required to transform a shape ...

    Borland had introduced  turtle graphics with TurboPascal 3.
In the subsequent versions, a compatibilt unit, TURBO3 was
provided but, even with version 6, it can only do turtle
graphics in the old CGA graphic modes !!! Quite desappointing
at the era of SVGA boards....

    This  unit , TURTLE.PAS  make possible the use of a turtle
with any graphic mode supported by the Graph unit.  whether it
is a standard graphic mode (EGAVGA,HERC,IBM8570..) or a user
written BGI driver such at the remarkable shareware SVGA
drivers written by .......

    To allow a nearly direct recompilation of previous
programs, the entries points are identical , in names and
parameters with the Turbo3 unit interface.

technical notes:

    This unit has been tested with all  BGI drivers supplied
by Borland Int'l in Turbopascal packages version 5.5  and 6.

    User installed BGI drivers were tested only with SVGA.BGI
driver of J.P.Hardgrave.

    The source code is self-documented.</PRE>
