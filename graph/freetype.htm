What is FreeType 1 ?
--------------------
     FreeType 1 is a portable and highly efficient TrueType rendering
     engine, that is now successfully used to bring TrueType support to a
     very large variety of platforms and environments, be they font
     servers, graphics libraries or embedded systems.

     FreeType 1 is a clean-room implementation that is not derived from
     the original TrueType engine developed by Apple and Microsoft. It has
     been created with the sole help of the published TrueType
     specifications, which to our great surprise (and pain) turned out to
     be extremely poor and misleading in critical areas. Much hard work
     has been undertaken to solve ambiguities.  The end result is a
     portable and fast renderer.

     Note that FreeType 1 is a library. It is not a font server for your
     favorite platform, even though it was designed to be used in many of
     them. Note also that it is not a complete text-rendering library. Its
     purpose is simply to open and manage font files, as well as load,
     hint and render individual glyphs efficiently. You can also see it as
     a "TrueType driver" for a higher-level library, though rendering text
     with it is easy, as demonstrated by the test programs.

     Its quality matches these of Windows and the Macintosh, while its
     memory foot-print and code size (between 48 and 55 kByte of Intel
     code) remain modest. A thing that cannot be said for most other
     commercial engines available.

     For more information, check our Download page or see the source and
     its diffs through our ViewCVS interface.


Features
--------
     The following features are part of FreeType 1:

    Supports TrueType files (TTF) and collections (TTC). Doesn't support
     GX or OpenType fonts, but these can be opened and used as normal TTF
     files by the library. (With the exception of OTF OpenType fonts which
     really embed a Type 1 font file within a TrueType storage).

    Modular design: Memory and I/O operations can be very easily tailored
     to your own platform/system (the standard release comes with ANSI
     libc support).

    Font smoothing, a.k.a. gray-scaling. Just like Win95, the renderer
     only smoothes the parts of a glyph which need it (i.e., diagonals and
     curves).

    Support for all character mappings defined in the TrueType
     specification. The client application can select whichever pleases
     it.

    A full-featured and efficient TrueType bytecode interpreter. The
     engine is able to produce excellent output at small point sizes. This
     component has been extremely difficult to get right, due to the
     ambiguous and misleadings TrueType specifications. However, we now
     match Windows and Mac qualities.

    Written in portable ANSI C (and Pascal, for older FreeType 1
     versions).  Should compile well on all kinds of systems (tested on
     16, 32 and 64 bits processors). With full source code available.

    Open Source License. FreeType can be included in all kinds of
     commercial systems and software.

    Provides test programs to "show-off" the library, runnable on the
     following platforms: Dos, Unix, OS/2, Win95, and Amiga. Any porters
     for other systems are welcome and should contact the developers team.

    Support for extensions. These are separately linkable units which can
     be used to enhance the engine's functionalities without recompiling
     it. They can be written to access additional TrueType tables, or even
     GX and/or OpenType ones (the latter is already available).

    Kerning support: The TrueType kerning data is available through one
     of the standard extensions that comes in this release. However, it is
     up to the application to "interpret" the data, as many different
     `formats' are supported.

    Support for vertical metrics. The engine is able to provide client
     applications with vertical glyph metrics if they are found in font
     files (usually in CJKV fonts). If not present, it synthetizes metrics
     from the horizontal values, ascender, and descender metrics. This
     means that it is possible to render vertical text correctly.

    Standard extensions are provided to access and load the glyph names
     in the Postscript table.

Requirements
------------
     The ANSI C version of the library should compile with no problems on
     a great variety of platforms. Some ANSI-compliant compilers may
     generate a lot of warnings when compiling it. These are not ANSI
     warnings and can be safely ignored. The reference compiler is gcc
     with the flags `-Wall' (all warnings) and `-ansi -pedantic', though
     using it is not a requirement.

     However, the test programs, which are used to demonstrate the engine,
     are more system-specific as they use a tiny graphics sub-system in
     order to display the engine's output on the screen or in a window.
     The sub-system supports right now the following platforms: Dos, OS/2,
     X11, Win95, and Amiga.  In addition, a platform independent driver
     for the Allegro graphics library is available.

     FreeType 1 comes with a Pascal version that now runs on Borland
     Pascal 7 (DOS), fPrint Virtual Pascal (OS/2), FPC (Linux, DOS, OS/2)
     as well as Delphi (16-bit & 32-bit versions). It is now almost
     up-to-date with the C version, even though it doesn't include
     extensions. It is located in the ftpascal CVS module.</PRE>
