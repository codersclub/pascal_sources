	____________

	This is the collection of Turbo Pascal routines to implement some
	3-D graphics. Just type L3D, and press ENTER at DOS prompt to get
	yourself in the 3-dimensional labyrinth. Instruction are provided
	online, just press F1, if you don't know what to do with it.

	This software was written because I wanted to know how might one
	do things like Wolfenstein-3D, and the best way was to do it
	myself. So why I have released these (buggy?) routines to shareware?
	Well, I think that I have nothing to loose, or have I?

	The source is slightly documented, but try to understand; I like to
	write programs, not documents. I think that clearly written program
	is 80% of the document, but I don't know if this is the case with
	Labyrinth-3D. (I might document the possible next verion little
	better, but this is not a promise).

	If you start fooling around with the source, sooner or later you
	will notice the lack of TxtMap.TPU source. There the shareware
	idea comes to play. You have to register to get it. Registeration
	fee is only $20 (or 100 Fmk), and should be sent to:

		Kimmo Fredriksson
		Silvontie 38
		37740 Haukila
		FINLAND


	You can send any comments and critics to same address. You can
	contact me via the Internet too: Kimmo.Fredriksson@Helsinki.FI


	And finaly the standard disclaimer: This author will not be
	resbonsible of any problems or damages associated with the use
	of Labyrinth-3D, whether they be physical, financial, psychological
	or theoretical. If you use L3D, you use it at your own risk!</PRE>
