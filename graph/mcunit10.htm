This is a small set of units supporting work in graphic  mode  in
Turbo Pascal 6.0. I wrote it for  my  personal  use,  that  means
units are not general, they are design for my purpose. Anyway  if
you find them useful be free to use them. If you find some troubles
let me know, you can let me know even if you don't find any problems.

I can be reached by e-mail:
    f51562@htrans.mech.kyoto-u.ac.jp (preferably) or
    f51562@sakura.kudpc.kyoto-u.ac.jp until  the  end  of  March.
    After that: K218C@CSPUNI12.BITNET

The set includes these units:
MCGRAF10 - supports line and bar charts, drawing while data are
    calculated
MCMENU10 - supports menu and status line usage
    (uses MCMICE10, MCXMS10)
    If you call InitXMS and XMS is available than screens will be
    saved to XMS instead of conventional memory. With great help
    of Michael Gallias I add procedures RegWinXMS, UnRegWinXMS and
    UseWinXMS which replace WinToXMS and WinFromXMS. These procedures
    allowed you to register of win type to XMS. Before usage call
    UseWinXMS and after that the usage is same as if you use RegWin.
    If you want to store variable in XMS after usage call UseWinXMS again.
MCMICE10 - supports mouse in your program
MCXMS10  - supports XMS (extended memory) usage
    this unit is based on XMSHEAP by Michael Gallias
    and TPXMS by Vernon E.Davis, Jr.

All units I tried to comment to be understandable. If you  anyway
don't understand something, ask me.

I included very simple testing program. First run setup to create
data which are read by test program.</PRE>
