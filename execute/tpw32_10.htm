    TPW32 - a package of UNITS to add
    32-bit functionality to BPW/Delphi
************************************************************
Version 1.00 (15 November 1995)


1. ORIGINAL DOCUMENTATION BY CHRISTIAN GHISLER
----------------------------------------------

 CALL32nt.pas: Library for Delphi/TPW/BPW to call 32 bit
               functions in Windows NT or Windows 95

Adapted to Pascal by Christian Ghisler, CIS: 100332,1175
from CALL32.DLL, a DLL for Visual Basic written and placed
in the Public Domain by Peter Golde.

This unit is placed in the public domain. Please feel free
to redistribute as you wish. No guarantees are made as to
its suitability or usefulness, and no support can be provided.


CALL32NT.PAS is a Unit that can be used for calling routines
in 32-bit DLLs on the Microsoft(R) Windows NT(TM) and/or
Windows 95(TM) operating system.
It cannot be used on Windows(TM) 3.1, Win32s(TM),
or other operating systems. Using it, a Delphi, Turbo or
Borland Pascal program, running in the Win16 subsystem,
can declare and call functions in any 32-bit DLL
(including, but not limited to, the system DLLs).


2. EXTRA DOCUMENTATION BY DR ABIMBOLA A. OLOWOFOYEKU
----------------------------------------------------
TPW32.PAS:

This package (originally called CALL32NT) is now called TPW32. It
includes the original CALL32NT.PAS (by Christian Ghisler) and
some of the original LONGNAME.PAS (also by Christian). I have
added some extra functions to LONGNAME.PAS and called the result
TPW32.PAS. I have also added a "types" unit (W32TYPES.PAS) which
implements data types and structures for use with the Win32 API.
There is a TEST.PAS which shows how to use some of the functions.
In most cases, I have tried to mimic as closely as possible, the
functions in the BPW runtime library (but with the letters "W32"
prepended to the function names).

The Win32 API contains several hundred functions. I have only
implemented a few. Hopefully, the package as it is will help many
people to add 32-bit functions to their BPW/Delphi programs. The
functions which are implemented herein provide ample examples for
those who wish to implement more of the Win32 API.

Please note that all the work that I have done on this was
primarily for my own purposes. I have not tested the functions in
all scenarios, and they may very well contain bugs. Some of the
functions contain klugdes. Some will work alright under Win95 but
will not work alright under NT - so you need to test under both
platforms. If you find a bug, please let me know. I cannot
promise to fix any bug, and since there will be no further
releases of this package from me, any bugs that I fix will only
be known to me.


LICENCE:
--------
This package is released into the public domain. This was
Christian Ghisler's original ideal, and I am following it. You
are getting this free.  Please do not charge anyone else for it.
If you add more functions please release them into the public
domain as well. But please indicate what you have added or
changed. The package may be distributed freely - as long as all
the files supplied by me are included, and NONE of my
documentation is removed or altered in any way.

SUPPORT ISSUES:
---------------
Please NOTE: this package is FREE software. I CANNOT PROVIDE ANY
SUPPORT AT ALL. Any attempt to ask me questions about this
package or how to use it will be met with total silence - so
please note that point. I have tried to add some comments to what
I did so as to provide some clues as to usage.  That is really
the best I can do, and that is all I intend to do.

DISCLAIMER
---------
I (Dr Abimbola Olowofoyeku) do NOT warantee ANYTHING concerning
any of the files which make up this TPW32 package. I accept NO
RESPONSIBILITY for ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE of ANY kind, including, but
not limited to, losses of a physical, mental, social, financial,
marital, or of whatever nature, resulting from the use, or the
purported use of TPW32 or any of the files in the package, for
any purpose whatsoever. I do not even warantee that the files
will not kill you. You use TPW32 ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK, and
you supply it to your customers, friends, family, acquaintances,
or enemies, ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. If these terms are NOT
acceptable to you, then you should delete all the TPW32 files
from all your disks immediately AND PERMANENTLY.
