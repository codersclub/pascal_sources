                             ABSTRACT

   If you  want to  know what is in a .TPU (unit) file produced
   by Version  6.0 of  Turbo Pascal from Borland International,
   then this  paper is  for you.    It  doesn't  explain  quite
   everything since the I don't have access to secret documents
   or anything  like that  and since  some of  the data in .TPU
   files just doesn't have enough auxiliary information to make
   its role  clear.   However, it  is possible to learn a great
   deal about  how Turbo  Pascal organizes  the information  it
   needs to  refer to,  and it  is also  possible to learn just
   what kind of code the compiler produces.

   This is  the third  in a series of reports on the subject of
   Turbo Pascal  Units, the  first treating  with Turbo  Pascal
   Version 5.0  and the  second with  Turbo Pascal  5.5.    The
   evolution  of   these  files   in  the   face  of   changing
   requirements has  been fascinating to behold and deciphering
   their contents has been challenging to say the least.

   The programs supplied with this report have been reorganized
   from their  5.5 style in some ways and many identifiers have
   been changed.   These  changes were  more for style than for
   substance.   Other changes  were dictated  by the changes in
   the organization  of the  TPU file itself and certain errors
   in the 5.5 programs have been corrected.  In addition, other
   errors of  interpretation have  been fixed  which has led to
   some enhanced descriptive capability.

   Since I  have a "real" job which requires my full attention,
   and since  it doesn't  involve use  of these products in any
   direct way,  I am  usually hard-pressed to find the personal
   time to  conduct this  research.    Consequently,  I  always
   refuse to  commit to follow-up or even error correction.  It
   would  be  irresponsible  of  me  to  pretend  it  could  be
   otherwise.  Even so, this is a revised report which contains
   a few  error fixes  and discusses the newly enhanced program
   which incorporates  these fixes  and  sports  some  enhanced
   capabilities.
