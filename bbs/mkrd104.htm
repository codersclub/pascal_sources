        (NOTE : MKRead is pronounced "Emm Kay Read" NEVER "McRead")
               (The MK stands for Mythical Kingdom Software)

------------[  Running Under LAN Or Multi-Tasking  ]-----------------

    The SysOp can run MKRead while a user is logged onto their
bulletin board and accessing the message base safely under these
conditions as long as SHARE is loaded in the system.  This makes MKRead
easier to use because it is possible to leave the BBS running, thus
giving uninterrupted service!

    A sample .PIF file is included for running MKRead under DESQview.
Any questions about operating under DESQview can be directed at Andy
Harris, either in the MK Echo or via netmail at FidoNet 1:3625/457.
The author, Mark May, runs in a LAN environment.  Efforts to contact
him are given on page 3.
