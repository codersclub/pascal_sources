                       Version 1.01a - September 24, 1993
                                    (c) 1993

DIZZY reformats any text file (with lines up to 255 characters long)
into 44 (or an alternate length) character lines, preparing it for
use as a FILE_ID.DIZ (a BBS .ZIP file contents descriptor).

PCBoard BBS's typically use the FILE_ID.DIZ (if it exists as a file
within the .ZIP file) as the upload description, and require that
description to be a maximum of 8 lines at up to 44 characters each.
DIZZY won't remove extra lines: it is up to the user to edit, and up
to DIZZY to reformat what the user has written.

     *** WARNING!!!  DIZZY OVERWRITES THE INPUT FILE, SO MAKE SURE
     THAT YOU EITHER WORK ON A COPY OF YOUR FILES OR YOU KNOW WHAT
     YOU ARE DOING BEFORE YOU START. ***

It will be impossible to have your file returned be to its original
state, but you may be able to retrieve the original with an undelete
program.

However, DIZZY does not remove text, so no matter what happens, you
will still have everything that you started with.

Usage:  DIZZY &lt;file_id.diz&gt; [line_length]

DIZZY takes one or two parameters on the command line: the name of
the file(s) to reformat and the line length desired.

The file name may contain wildcards, for example: "DIZZY *.diz"
(without the quotes) would reformat all files with the extension
".diz".

The line length must be a number between 40 and 127.  The default
(used if none is specified) is 44 characters.

Note: DIZZY removes leading and trailing spaces from all lines, and
changes all occurrences of multiple spaces into single spaces.
It leaves hard tabs and ASCII 255 (a blank character that is not a
space) intact. 

Finally, I have noticed a couple of FILE_ID.DIZ editors available,
but have not tried them.  I wrote (and use) DIZZY because I don't
want to learn how to use another editor - especially if the author
is asking for a registration fee.  I like DIZZY because, like most
of my programs, it is small, simple, fast, and free.  I really do not
need or want a mule of a GUI like Microsoft Windows (tm).
