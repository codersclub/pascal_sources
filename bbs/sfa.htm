                       (for Opus 1.7x or above)
  Written by Gianfranco "Frankie" Lanzilli for his Boss Alberto Enna
]\/[imac Opus BBs - +39-6-2751446 - 2:335/12@fidonet.org - Roma, Italy
           Typewritten documentation by Alberto "Alby" Enna

THE IDEA

When Opus 1.7x came out, with the new FILESBBS.DAT data base was
"discovered" one of most interesting features of such structure: to
let  each one file in particular Area have an own privilege for
Download, not only the AREA one...! 
With OPUS-FAM it's a joke, now, to  set right privileges  for each
file...but it's very "tedious" to do it with a large amount of Files.
The IDEA was growing up...and NOW here's the right answer: SFA.EXE.


WHAT IT DOES

The GOAL is  to change the privilege for all files (or someone) in a
desired Area.
When changes are made to BBS.CTL file for the Download/Access
Privilege, in a particular Area, old privileges aren't changed,
by NACL.  So, you must give the new  privilege to each file in that
Area, i.e. with  OPUS-FAM , or other file managers.


THE SOURCE

We've included in the package the Source file,  in Turbo Pascal v5.5,
as for all the other little routines  that we've developed in the past.
This is our way-to-operate,  and be sure  that's the best way to
develop in programming.
Examine it, and let's Frankie have a feed-back, if you retain...
