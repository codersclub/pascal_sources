                             INTRODUCTION:
                             ------------
DDplus is a package of pascal units for use in creating programs for
use with Bulletin Board Systems (BBS).  These programs are called
"DOORS" and are stand alone products which "link" with the BBS to
allow users to enjoy games and utilities of all types.  The DDPlus
package takes the tedium out of Door programming by allowing you to
concentrate on the writing of door specific code and not having to
worry about details such working with fossils, multi-tasker support,
handling communications I/O and the processing of BBS drop Files.
This package does NOT teach Turbo Pascal programming. It assumes
that you know basic Turbo Pascal programming already, and desire
to put that knowledge to use by designing a door for a BBS.

                    Features of DDPLUS and the DDPLus Kit:
                    --------------------------------------

 1. IRQs 0-15 are supported.

 2. Comports 1-4 supported.

 3. Selectable Port Addresses.

 4. DesqView aware routines.

 5. Detects Rip.

 6. Fast and correct ansi color routines.

 7. Lock baud and comm baud rates to 115,200

 8. Built in Windows, WindowsNT and OS/2 time slice releasing.

 9. Fossil support to 38,400 using normal fossil calls.

10. Fossil support to 115,200 using extended fossil calls. Use XFossil
    for any fossils (X00 or BNU) over 38,400.  This option does not open
    or close the fossil but only writes to it the way it is.

11. Local video can be toggled off to save processing time in
    multitasking windows or to give some user privacy when competing
    in game against the sysop.

12. Multiple control files can be accessed by a command line parm.

13. Will work with OR without the presence of a fossil.

14. ALL source code is provided and you can modify it to do whatever
    you need it to do!  Just be sure to document your changes as new
    versions of DDPLUS come out periodically and will not have your
    changes in them. A better idea would be to make a separate add
    on unit for use with the main DDPLUS units so that you do not
    have to edit the DDPlus units each time a new DDPlus version
    comes out.

15. A Turbo Vision program skeleton is provided for use as a door
    setup/configuration/editor program.

16. An Inter BBS Door unit is provided so you can make your door an
    inter BBS one if you desire.

17. DDSETUP.EXE is provided for distribution with your Door program
    to help users configure the required CTL file for use with your
    door. It is FREEWARE.

18. A file/record locking unit is provided to allow you to design
    multi-node/online multi-player games.

19. An automatic overlay unit is included for making programs
    overlays to conserve memory and automatically initializes them.

20. RipLink is now provided so that you can build in a local display
    of RIP graphics for a using sysop.

                             REQUIREMENTS:
                             ------------
At this point in time the only requirements are that you must be using
Borland Turbo Pascal 7.0.  Most of the kit should also work with
version 6.0 as well, but we no longer guarantee it.  If you use file
locking and sharing then users must be notified that SHARE is required
to be loaded prior to use. The same goes for ANSI.SYS as well if ANSI
graphics are used. 

                            Files Included
                            --------------

               Single node WildCat Support BBS to run my DDPlus Games.
               Feel free to distribute these batch files with your
               DDPLus game package creations.
GAME.CTL     - Un-edited and heavily commented Control file for use
               with all doors produced with the DDplus package.
