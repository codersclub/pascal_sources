                          An On-Line Door Support Unit
                      For use with Turbo Pascal 5.5 and 6.0


  TriDoor is the  most advanced,  efficient  and easy-to-use  utility of
it's kind available  on the software  market today.  It allows  even the
novice  Borland  Turbo Pascal  programmer  to  create  fully-functioning
doors,  on-line  programs and utilities  in a  matter of minutes without
ever having to  delve  into  the hundreds  of  texts  on  communications
programming.

  In addition  to having complete  communications  support  TriDoor also
comes equipped with many  other features which are extremely useful when
writing communications  applications.  Examples of  these are color ANSI
graphics controls,  user time  handling routines  and  many  Pascal-like
commands such as td_writeln() which is the communications  equivalent of
write() and writeln().

  TriDoor is  flexible too!  With  the  exception of  a few  things here
and there (like the tell-tale chat mode) your  users may never even know
that you  did not write  the entire program- communications routines and
all.  You will see no  hard-coded error  messages,  forced configuration
files or annoying  restrictions that you did not develop yourself.  This
allows you to  use all  your programming  resources  the way YOU want as
opposed to the way a tool kit may  have set them up.  A prime example of
this is command line parameters; some tool kits  will force you to enter
in the name  of a configuration  file on  the command line.  What if you
would rather enter in an IRQ setting or a user name?  What if you do not
want a configuration file?  TriDoor allows you to do as you will.

  The programming  possibilities  are endless- I  have  written  on-line
games,  archive  viewing  utilities,  text/ANSI  graphics  file viewers,
"top ten list"  generators,  terminal  programs, SysOp  paging doors and
many MANY more.

  How many  times have you said to yourself, "This is truly an excellent
system I have running if  only I could add on a [blank] without changing
to a new  BBS  software..."?  Well, there  are a  few solutions  to this
problem:  You could switch BBS software which may give you a few options
you did not have before but you are also reducing yourself to rebuilding
a system  you have already put  probably hundreds  of hours of work into
and potentially compromising the quality of your user's environment -or-
you  could  download a  door  from your  local BBS  where you may find a
program to do what you need, but it  may  not  be  EXACTLY what you want
-or- you could use TriDoor to write your own!  You  could have  the door
you want, make  the changes you  need at ANY  time and have the pleasure
of having made it yourself.

  I frequently  find  myself saying, "If you cannot do  it with TriDoor,
then you  probably cannot do it."   I have only  scraped the  surface of
it's capabilities  and ease of use; the  rest is up to you. You now hold
the power to make the doors,  on-line games and utilities  that you have
always wanted!


                           FEATURES OF TRIDOOR


  TriDoor has  many  advanced and  VERY easy-to-use  features  which are
built  right in.  And  although  there are   so many  that  I  literally
cannot  remember ALL  of them, we are  still adding all the time so give
us a call so we can get you a copy of the latest version.

     * NOW VERY INEXPENSIVE!  SEE LICENSING AGREEMENT!

     * Automatic set-up and support of communications ports
     * Automatic reading and processing of DORINFO1.DEF and PCBOARD.SYS
     * Easy to use commands such as td_writeln() and td_readln() which
       function as communications supporting equivalents of the Turbo
       Pascal commands
     * Built-in chat mode with word-wrap and ANSI color graphics
     * Boolean variable halt_program which is set to TRUE if [F8] is
       hit from the local keyboard- allows for programmer-defined
       or non-existent "hang-up" procedures
     * Easy forced "caps-lock", and "password-entry" (see "***"
       instead of "hey" or "YOU" instead of "you")
     * Length restriction available on input fields
     * Built-in string capitalization, first letter capitalization and
       easy integer/longint to string conversion available
     * Built-in direct screen write functions
     * Automatic status bar displaying time, name and baud rate
     * Automatic on-line user time handling routines
     * Built-in routines for clearing user's and local screen
     * Built-in Boolean response "Are you sure?" function
     * Built-in user-page (&gt;BEEP!&lt; "The SysOp is paging you!" &gt;BEEP!&lt;)
     * Automatic "Last Printed" memory (can be disabled)
     * Command list status bar on local screen
     * Auto-sensing of color/monochrome local screen
     * Borland Turbo Pascal 5.5 AND 6.0 support
     * Full color ANSI graphics support
     * User on-line time modification
     * Auto-hang-up (halt_program := TRUE) at time&lt;1
     * System messages in status bar  ("SysOp : User is being paged.")
     * Ability to EASILY add support for ANY BBS system
     * Ability to be run in multi-tasking environments such as
       DESQVIEW and WINDOWS.
     * Local disable/enable of remote user keyboard
     * Fake line-noise from local console
     * Ability to use non-standard IRQ/COMM port configurations
     * Ability to change all communications parameters
     * Locked communications port support
     * Complete flow control support (XON/XOFF and CTS/RTS)
     * Configurable/disableable user keyboard time-out feature
     * Messages such as "Entering chat mode." can now be changed
     * Configurable return to normal status bar after nn seconds
     * Procedure naming conventions similar to Turbo Pascal's
     * Efficient, fast, operation
     * ANSI capable display_file() procedure
     * Ability to disable local screen from program or [F9]
     * PCBoard convention SysOp local control command keys
     * A built-in DOS shell

                              ... And more!
