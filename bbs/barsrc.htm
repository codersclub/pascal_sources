Hi!  Ever wanted to make your own IGM but were too lazy to figure out
how, etc?  Well now you can compile this one in seconds, and begin
changing it to create your own.  This is FULL source, EVERYTHING is
changable.

This IGM is the perfect template because it is the only IGM I wrote for
LORD, and is the only one that completely follows my standards, and is
able to work with all fossil/com port configurations properly without
using drop files.

It also demonstrates how to keep track of who has used the IGM that day,
and automatically resets everyone when a new day starts, by reading from
time.dat.

The configure program is easy to use, and even stores the LORD dir you
installed it two, so uninstalling is a snap!

There are hundreds of usefull procedures in here, even though they are
a few years old.  Use them wisely, child!

I did change two things right before I zipped this - I took off the
part in the config program that wouldn't allow more than 9 IGM's to be
used at once, and I changed it to allow node 0. (Barak was created
before node 0 or 10+ IGM were allowed)

BCSHARE and DVAWARE have been enclosed in their shareware form so you
don't have to go find them - this package contains everything you need
to compile BARAK.EXE and BARAKCFG.EXE.

Special thanks to Steve Lorenze, Bob Dalton and Scott Baker for
writing DDPLUS.

License agreement:

You may use this kit as an example IGM, and modify it to create your
own, using any or all of Seth's routines enclosed - You may NOT compile
this and sell it as is, or distribute ANYTHING resembling Barak's house
or associated with Barak's house.

(ie, you can't go create your own version of Seth's Barak House -
that is Seth's job, don't mess with that!!)

Barak's House is a copyrighted program, and all rights are reserved.

You can however make your OWN IGM with it and sell it, or use pieces
of the source in your own door and sell that.

************

Info:

BARAK.PAS:  The main file for barak's house.

BARAKCFG.PAS:  The setup program.

-= Other files the above use =-

ALLPAS.PAS:  Contains MANY generic routines, can be 'used' by any
piece of source. (the headers are commented to explain each routine)

SETHLIB.PAS:  DOS non modem specific routines such as string and
              number input routines, cannot be used with DDPLUS,
              but are used in dos only applications such as
              BARAKCFG.PAS.

SETHLIBB.PAS:  The ddplus version of the string and number input
              routines, can only be used inside a door, because it
              calls SWRITELN directly.

DDPLUSB.PAS:  Modified DDPLUS, with things in it for Barak's house.

DDOVRB and DDOVR2B:  Modifed DDPLUS support files, allow reading of
              the node dat and info.* files.  Also some texts have
              been added and changed to reflect BARAK'S house.
              You would want to change these for your own IGM.

BAR_VAR.PAS:  All the varibles - they are put in a seperate TPU
              because most .pas files USE them.  The lord structures
              are in this.

********** TO COMPILE THIS THING **********

Unzip to a separate dir (hopefully you already did this)

Have Turbo Pascal installed, and the bin dir in your path.

type:
TPC -b barak.pas
tpc -b barakcfg.pas

Those two exe's will be built.  From there, check out BARAK.PAS,
you should be able to figure out how things work by looking at them.
The arcade sequences in Barak's house are tricky to read, but when
doing something like that, you should probably write it from scratch
yourself anyway, or you will never fully understand it.

Sethln and Seth replace Swrite and Swriteln.  You can use color codes
inside of them.

IMPORTANT:  If you change the name of the file, be sure to change all
instances of BARAK.EXE with YOURNAME.EXE in DDOVR2B.PAS, it uses this
to find what dir it is, if you don't, it won't figure out where the
NODE?.DAT is and not work. This is also kind of security from people
changing your filename.

** ABOUT STRING INPUT COMMANDS **

They are Edi() and Edi_num(), learn how to use them by example in
BARAKCFG.PAS.  They are nifty!


*****  If you have any questions, ask Seth. *****

*****  Many routines were written years ago and are quite ugly,
       feel free to beautify them for your own ease of use
