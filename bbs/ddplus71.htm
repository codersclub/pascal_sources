            WHAT'S IT GOING TO COST YOU TO USE THIS PACKAGE?
            ------------------------------------------------
Nothing! The DDPlus package is distributed as FREEWARE and requires NO
registration and NO royalties for door products produced with this
package. It would be nice though if you credit the DDplus Door Kit in
your program with a line that says something like "Another DDPLus Door
Program" or something similar and in the documentation so that others
will know it is a product based on the DDPlus kit. The individual
authors of this package will NOT however turn down a registered copy
of any program created with this package, if it is offered to us in
appreciation for all the work involved &lt;grin&gt;. These will ALWAYS be
gladly accepted! (Hey, we ARE sysops as well as programmers after all!!)

                             INTRODUCTION:
                             ------------
DDplus is a package of pascal units for use in creating programs for
use with Bulletin Board Systems (BBS).  These programs are called
"DOORS" and are stand alone products which "link" with the BBS to
allow users to enjoy games and utilities of all types.
The DDPlus package takes the tedium out of Door programming by
allowing you to concentrate on the writing of door specific code
and not having to worry about details such working with fossils,
multi-tasker support, handling communications I/O and the processing
of BBS drop Files. This package does NOT teach Turbo Pascal
programming. It assumes that you know basic Turbo Pascal programming
already, and desire to put that knowledge to use by designing a door
for a BBS.

                    Features of DDPLUS and the DDPLus Kit:
                    --------------------------------------

 1. IRQs 0-15 are supported.

 2. Comports 1-4 supported.

 3. Selectable Port Addresses.

 4. DesqView aware routines.

 5. Detects Rip.

 6. Fast and correct ansi color routines.

 7. Lock baud and comm baud rates to 115,200

 8. Built in Windows, WindowsNT and OS/2 time slice releasing.

*9. Fossil support to 115,200 using extended fossil calls.
    Since release of 7.0 we have received the specifications on how to
    set the baud rate for highspeed bnu fossils.  Now port speeds of
    57,600 and 115,200 for both X00 and BNU can be handled by either
    the FOSSIL or the XFOSSIL options.  Once again FOSSIL will
    initialize the detected fossil to the port speed and XFOSSIL will
    accept the fossil as-is with no initialization.

10. Local video can be toggled off to save processing time in
    multitasking windows or to give some user privacy when competing
    in game against the sysop.

11. Multiple control files can be accessed by a command line parm.

12. Will work with OR without the presence of a fossil.

13. ALL source code is provided and you can modify it to do whatever
    you need it to do!  Just be sure to document your changes as new
    versions of DDPLUS come out periodically and will not have your
    changes in them. A better idea would be to make a separate add on
    unit for use with the main DDPLUS units so that you do not have
    to edit the DDPlus units each time a new DDPlus version comes out.

14. A Turbo Vision program skeleton is provided for use as a door
    setup/configuration/editor program.

15. An Inter BBS Door unit is provided so you can make your door an
    inter BBS one if you desire.

*18. DDSETUP.EXE is provided for distribution with your Door program
    to help users configure the required CTL file for use with your
    door. It is FREEWARE.

19. A file/record locking unit is provided to allow you to design
    multi-node/online multi-player games.

20. An automatic overlay unit is included for making programs overlays
    to conserve memory and automatically initializes them.

21. RipLink is now provided so that you can build in a local display of
    RIP graphics for a using sysop.

                             REQUIREMENTS:
                             ------------
At this point in time the only requirements are that you must be
using Borland Turbo Pascal 7.0.  Most of the kit should also work with
version 6.0 as well, but we no longer guarantee it.  If you use file
locking and sharing then users must be notified that SHARE is required
to be loaded prior to use. The same goes for ANSI.SYS as well if ANSI
graphics are used.

                            Files Included
                            --------------

                              CREDITS:
                              --------
This relatively small section is just to recognize the people who have
made the DDPLUS package a possibility.

Scott Baker       -=*=-  The authors of the original DoorDriver Kit
and                      are to be thanked for releasing the
Derrick Parkhurst        source code to their great kit!  Without
                         that act of kindness DDPLUS would NOT
                         be possible.  Hopefully Steve and I
                         have done your kit justice and given it
                         a new lease on life in the programming
                         world. Scott is the author of several
                         door games, most notably Land of Devastation,
                         which uses the original doordriver kit.

Steven Lorenz      -=*=- The author of the enhanced add on package
                         to Scott Bakers DoorDriver Kit. Thanks to
                         his code modifications, add ons and enhancements
                         DDPLus is a much more complete and capable
                         package then originally released in the
                         DoorDriver Kit. He is also responsible for
                         the DDPlus setup program which he freely donated.
                         Steve is the author of several door games, most
                         notably Railroad Empires, Romans At War, and
                         Empires at War, all of which use DDPlus.

Bob Dalton         -=*=- The author of most of the documentation in this
                         package and contributor of the OVERLAY.ZIP,
                         LOCKING.ZIP, ELOG.ZIP and many other items in
                         this kit. Bob is the author of several door
                         games, such as GodFather of Crime, Rise To
                         Power, Task Force Broadside, Ship of the Line,
                         Grunt Fest, Way Freight and the Adventure Door
                         Game Toolkit, all of which use DDPLus.

Andy Stewart       -=*=- The author of the IBBS.ZIP portion of the
                         DDPLUS kit. Great job Andy!

Tom Morgan         -=*=- The author of the RIPLINK.ZIP portion of DDPLUS
                         for deciding to make his RipLink package
                         freeware and include it in the DDPLus kit.

                         Where to reach us
                         -----------------

We can usually be reached at the following places:

Steven Lorenz - The Officer Club BBS
              - Telephone Number: 818-249-8579 (CA)

Bob Dalton    - The TANSTAFL BBS
              - Telephone Number: 501-741-5699 (AR).
                FIDO Node Number: 1:391/3010

Scott Baker   - Although he NO longer supports his original DoorDriver
                kit I am sure he would appreciate any free program you
                were to offer him. He can be reached at his Not Yet Named
                BBS at 602-544-4655 (AZ) or FIDO Node Number 1:300/9. Keep
                in mind he will NOT answer any questions about this kit!

NOTE:  Both Steve Lorenz and Bob Dalton habitually monitor the FIDO door
       related National and International echos if you have questions.
       Bob Dalton also monitors the Pascal FIDO echo as well. Address
       ALL questions about DDPlus to either Steve or Bob and no one
       else, assuming you want an answer that is.  Since this package
       is FREEWARE, please do not expect us to send you a reply back at
       our expense, either call back for it or poll us via FIDO 48 hours
       after you netmailed the question.
Thanks!</PRE>
