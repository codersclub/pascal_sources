  Introduction
  ------------

| AvDoor evolved from another program of mine called AIchat, and later
| closed the circle by being used to implement further releases of that
| program.  However, I needed to write a number of other online programs,
| and thus AvDoor was born.  Pretty soon people were asking me if they
| could use my routines and I decided to release this unit as shareware.

  AvDoor provides most of the underlying infrastructure needed by almost
  every online program, including:

  * FOSSIL detection (but will work without one)
  * ANSI emulation (doesn't need ANSI.SYS installed!)
  * Local console screen I/O and status line (using only BIOS calls)
  * Built-in chat mode with word-wrap and logging
    (and optional shell-to-DOS)
  * BBS interfaces, command-line mode and local operation
  * Timeout, time used and hangup detection (very important!)
  * Software registration keys (with registered copies of AvDoor only)


  Installation
  ------------

  You will need to rename AVDOOR55.TPU to AVDOOR.TPU if you are using
  Turbo Pascal 5.5, or rename AVDOOR60.TPU to AVDOOR.TPU if you are
  using Turbo Pascal 6.0.  If you are using any other programming
  language, please contact me to find out if a version of AvDoor to suit
| you is planned.  Source code for parts of AvDoor may be available in
| later releases if requested - contact the author for pricing.


  Contents
  --------

| This manual is gradually being expanded with every release of AvDoor.
| At present it consists of the following information:  A summary of the
| types, constants and variables (in that order) defined by AvDoor, an
| explanation of the ShellProc variable with a sample DosShell function,
| a brief summary of the functions and procedures provided by AvDoor, a
| longer explanation of each of the procedures and functions, and a
| (very simple!) sample program.  Hopefully that should be enough to get
| you started, but if you have any further questions feel free to
| contact me by any of the means listed at the beginning of this
| documentation.  Priority will obviously be given to registered users.
