    Hi

    I wrote this unit  over  a  number  of  years  and thought that other
    people who have not yet written  such  a  unit could benefit from it.
    So I wrote a .NG file for it and released it.

    If you like this unit,  please  let  me  know.  Donations, letters or
    postcards are welcome, especially postcards.

    If you do send any money, please  send  cash,  either rands or US$'s.
    Make sure you  use  a  dark  envelope  so  the  cash  cannot be seen.
    Please don't send coins  in  the  post.   If  you  can't get US$'s or
    rands, you are welcome to send me whatever currency you are using.

    Remember, this software  is  free,  you  don't have to pay for it.  I
    would really appreciate a  postcard  if  you use this software, money
    is not so important.  I  won't  nag  you  about money, I just want to
    know if my software is used.

    I suppose there could  be  even  more  features  for  me to add but I
    don't know if anyone is going to  use  this.   If there is sufficient
    response for any of my products I'll improve that product.

    This software is free  and  I  take  no  responsibility  for any loss
    or damages.


    I can usually be contacted via Internet,  isapeg@images.cs.und.ac.za,
    or  preferably  on  gallias@ph.und.ac.za.  I  also  have  Fidonet  on
    5:7103/6 Michael Gallias.  Then there is always post.

    BBS's are good too:

    Connectix          (031) 266 9992        My ID: Mission
    Honey In The Rock  (031) 463 1709        My ID: Michael Gallias

    If I don't reply  to  EMail  (within  say  2  weeks),  it could be an
    EMail  problem.   I  always  reply  quickly.   So  if  no  reply, I'm
    not being  rude,  I  probably  just  didn't  get  the  EMail.   These
    things happen.</PRE>
