The  Personal  Communications  Library  for Turbo and Borland
Pascal (PCL4P) is  an  asynchronous  communications  library
designed  for experienced  software  developers  programming  in
Turbo or Borland Pascal. The PCL features:

-  Supports protected mode.
-  32 communications and support functions.
-  Support for the high performance INS16550 UART.
-  Supports hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control.
-  Interrupt driven receiver and transmitter (optional).
-  Supports 300 baud to 115,200 baud.
-  Supports the PC/4 and PC/8 DigiBoard.
-  Supports the BB1004, BB1008, and BB2016 BOCA boards.
-  COM1 through COM20 defined.
-  Adjustable receive queues from 8 bytes to 32 KB.
-  Control-BREAK error exit.
-  19 communications error conditions trapped.
-  4 ports can run concurrently (more with multiport boards).
-  Complete modem control & status.
-  Written in assembly language for small size & high speed.

Several example programs (source code) are provided along  with
the small  model  library  and  makefiles  for  each  of  the
supported compilers.  The example programs are:

(1)  MINIMAL  is the absolutely minimal terminal emulator program.
It is hard coded to use COM1 at 9600.

(2)  SIMPLE  is an extremely  simple  terminal  emulator  program.
Start it by supplying a port number and a baud rate,

     SIMPLE 1 9600

(3)  DOOR  is  very similiar to SIMPLE, but it "takes over" a port
in that the UART  is  not  reset,  and  all  parameters  including
the baud rate are acquired unchanged.

(4)   LOGIN is a variation on SIMPLE. It dials up the MarshallSoft
BBS and logs on as GUEST.

The shareware distribution does not include the source code to the
library, but all example code is included.

For more information, refer to the Personal Communications Library
Users  Manual  (PCL4P.USR)  and  Personal  Communications  Library
Reference Manual (PCL4P.REF), which are part of PCL4P41.ZIP.

A C version of the library (PCL4C) is also available.
