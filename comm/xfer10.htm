Many  thanks  go  to  Wayne  Conrad of Pascalaholics Anonymous
BBS (602-484-9356,  300/1200/2400  baud)  for  writing  the
IBMCOM 3.0 unit  and  placing  it in the Public Domain.  Without
IBMCOM, this program would not have been possible.


This  program  provides full support for Xmodem Checksum, CRC,
and 1K  file  transfers  for  the IBM PC and compatibles.  Great
pains have  been  taken  to heavily document the code for clarity
in the operations  that take place in an Xmodem transfer.  I
realize that there  are  other much more sophisticated programs
out there which support  Xmodem  **  AND  A BUNCH MORE PROTOCOLS
**, which you all will  be  using  for  transfers with your
terminal programs.  This program  does  not  intend  to  compete
with these other protocol drivers.    Its  main  attraction is
the fact that I have made the source  code  open  and available
to all programmers to review. It is  dedicated  to  all  those
fine individuals who once helped me with  questions  or  problems
in  programming,  and I release the source  code  to  all  in
hopes  that it may be of help to others attempting to support
Xmodem.




Use  of  this  program  is very simple.  The program is invoked
by entering  a  command  line according to the following
description:


XFER [Port n] [Speed n] Command [Options] Path\File


[Port n] :

This  optional  parameter tells XFER which COM Port to use for
the transfer.    This can be from 1 to 4.  If [port n] is
omitted, the default port is 1.


[Speed n] :

This  optional parameter sets the speed of the transfer.  This
can be  300,  600,  1200,  2400,  4800,  9600, or 19200 baud.  If
this parameter  is  omitted,  the  current speed of the port
being used becomes default.


Command :

This  parameter  indicates which operation to perform.  As of
this version,  you  may  use  'sx'  to  send Xmodem, or 'rx' to
receive Xmodem.   It is expected that other protocols will be
supported in later versions.

[Options] :

These  consist  of  '-C'  for  CRC  mode  transfers,  and '-K'
for support  of  Xmodem 1K transfers.  If no options are
selected, the protocol becomes Xmodem Checksum, with 128 byte
blocks.

Path\File :

This  parameter  determines  which file is to be sent or
received.  Wild  cards  are  not permitted, as Xmodem transfers
are not batch transfers.    As batch protocols become available,
wild cards will be supported.




When  exiting,  this  program  provides an error code which can
be detected  by  ERRORLEVEL  in batch files.  The following are
valid codes, followed by their meanings.


Code    Definition
---------------------------------------------------------------
  0     No error occurred.  Transfer terminated normally.

  1     Error opening file.  Possibly bad disk, or file
        is not found.

  2     Operator aborted transfer by pressing a key during
        the transfer.

  3     Remote computer cancelled transfer

  4     Maximum number of timeouts or other block errors
        has been exceeded (usually 10), and transfer is
        aborting.

  5     Block received out of sequence.  Protocol aborts
        promptly under these conditions.

  6     Timeout while waiting for final EOT from
        transmitter.  Some implementations of Xmodem do
        not wait for the final EOT to be ACK'd before
        exiting, and thus will not re-send it when it is
        NAK'd the first time.  This causes a timeout while
        waiting for the second EOT, and not receiving one.
        Nothing serious is wrong here, except that the
        transmitter is not fully supporting the now
        recognized Xmodem standard.  When this code is
        received, it is nothing more than a warning,  and
        should only be worried about if the file received
        seems incomplete at the end.

  7     No carrier.  Must have carrier to transfer.

252     Invalid operation on command line.  The only valid
        operations are SX (send Xmodem) and RX (receive
        Xmodem).  Any others will cause this exit code.

253   Invalid [Options] selected on command line.  Only
        -C and -K are valid, any others will cause this
        exit code.

254     Invalid baud rate specified.  This is caused when
        using [Speed n] to select a baud rate that is
        other than 300, 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, and
        19200.

255     Invalid COM Port number.  This is caused by using
        [Port n] to specify a COM port other than 1 - 4,
        or when specifying a COM port that does not exist.
        For example, specifying 'PORT 3' on a system that
        only has two COM ports, will cause this error.

Examples of use:

	Specify Xmodem Checksum send, COM1, current baud:
		xfer sx myfile.zip

	Specify Xmodem CRC send, COM1, current baud:
		xfer sx -c myfile.zip

	Specify Xmodem 1K send, COM1, current baud:
		xfer sx -k myfile.zip      or
		xfer sx -k -c myfile.zip

	Specify Xmodem Checksum receive, COM1, current baud:
		xfer rx myfile.zip

	Specify Xmodem CRC or 1K receive, COM1, current baud:
		xfer rx -c myfile.zip      or
		xfer rx -c -k myfile.zip   or
		xfer rx -k myfile.zip
	*  Note that all three of these commands will receive
	   Xmodem 1K or Xmodem CRC, whichever the xmitter decides
	   to transmit.  As always, if the xmitter does not support
	   CRC, the protocol will drop back to Xmodem Checksum.
	   All Xmodem 1K transfers are assumed to be CRC by default
	   (thus the third command line possibility is listed as
	   an alternative to the second one).  It is possible to
	   initiate an Xmodem Checksum 1K transfer if the xmitter
	   forces a drop back to checksum, but then sends 1K
	   blocks (this is not recommended due to the checksum
	   being less accurate as block size increases).

	Specify Xmodem Checksum send, COM2, current baud rate:
		xfer port 2 sx myfile.zip

	Specify Xmodem CRC send, COM4, at 9600 baud:
		xfer port 4 speed 9600 sx -c myfile.zip
