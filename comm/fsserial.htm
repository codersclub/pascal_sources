SERIAL is a unit written to take advantage of many of the FOSSIL drivers
out on the market such as X00.SYS or BNU.COM.
If the system does not detect a FOSSIL driver in memory,
then it resorts to standard interrupt driven serial I/O
without the ability to open up more than one port at a time.</font>

This unit is designed to allow the user to use a FOSSIL driver for
a serial unit that is event-driven aware.  To do this, the input
from the modem is given an event status number just like the mouse or
keyboard.  All input is then routed directly through the event driver
for all your dialogs to use.  The output to the modem is in the form
of a series of events that you can use or direct calls via an object.
Note that these calls are the basics and do not halt for buffer
overruns in either Tx or Rx.  Your application program will have to
monitor the serCarrier and serTxBuffer events to keep track if there
is a carrier or if there is room in the TX buffer for more to be
sent.

Note that this unit was written to take advantage of many of the
FOSSIL drivers out on the market such as X00.SYS or BNU.COM.  If
the system does not detect a FOSSIL driver in memory, then it
resorts to standard interrupt driven serial I/O without the ability
to open up more than one port at a time. (Currently... This may
change in the future)


ANSIVIEW.PAS - 24 January 1991

This Unit was written so that I had something that reminded me of the
original WRITELN and WRITE statments of pascal where I was working
with the screen and there were various definate controls I had using
the GOTOXY and CLRSCR routines.  Under TVision, you no longer have
these controls and need to learn a completely different way of getting
info on the screen.

AnsiView was written to give you some of these old methods while still
using the TVision platform. That is, your screen is a scroll window of
your size choosing (You can define a screen 128,2048 and use the gotoxy
to get to anywhere on that screen!)  Also if you turn on the ANSI
option, the driver will recognise ANSI controls (For reading those ANSI
files directly and displaying them!)

Because this is also a TVision enviroment, your screen will also be
saved if you do a desktop save! Wonderful stuff eh?</PRE>
