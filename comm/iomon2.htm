---------------------------------------
IOMON is a protected mode I/O monitor written by Rick Knoblaugh and
published in an article in Programmer's Journal (volume 9, number 5).
The program files for IOMON are copyright 1991 ASMicro and distributed
here with their permission.

IORPT is a reporting program that reads the memory resident data buffer
maintained by IOMON and produces several reports. IORPT was written by
Terry Hughes of TurboPower Software and is released to the public
domain.

Version 2.0
10/92


Overview
--------
IOMON and IORPT can be used to monitor and report on the serial port I/O
performed by any communications program. As you might guess by their
names, IOMON does the monitoring and IORPT does the reporting.

This combination of programs can add some powerful and convenient
debugging capabilites to your toolbox. Previously, if you wanted to
monitor the exchange of data in a serial link you needed a data scope or
an extra PC (and cables) equipped with data scope-like software. While
there will still probably be times when only a data scope will do, IOMON
and IORPT make it possible to monitor many such communication exchanges
directly on one of the participating machines.

IOMON is a memory resident monitor that tracks all accesses to a
specified range of I/O ports. As presented here, its intended purpose is
to monitor the range of I/O ports that belong to a UART. The tremendous
utility of such a program is that it can monitor communications programs
as they run, without interfering with them, and note all serial data
input and output as well as modem and line control performed by that
program.

IOMON was originally published in Programmer's Journal as a general
purpose I/O port monitor. We've made one small modification to it to
allow the its information buffer to be truly circular (as published, the
buffer was cleared everytime it wrapped).

We've supplied the file IOMON.EXE executable file as well as the source
code files distributed with the Programmer's Journal article (with our
small modification). For more information about how IOMON works we
suggest you read Rick Knoblaugh's article on the program in Programmer's
Journal 9.5.

IORPT is a reporting program that reads IOMON's memory resident data
buffer and produces two reports -- a "trace" and "audit" report. The
trace report is identical to the Tracing facility provided by Async
Professional. The audit report is similar to Async Professional's event
logging report except that it lacks a time stamp.

Note that while IOMON is a general purpose I/O monitor, IORPT assumes
that IOMON is currently being used to monitor the UART ports of COM
port. Running IORPT while IOMON is monitoring some non-UART port
addresses will give unpredictable results.</PRE>
