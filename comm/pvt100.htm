<TR><TD colspan=3><PRE><p style="margin-left:50px">PVT100 is actually a translation into pascal (tp 6.0) of
CVT100 a VT100 emulator written in C by Jerry Joplin. This
translation was "homework" for me as I wanted to learn how to
write a small communication package. I was impressed with the
fact that CVT100 was Windows and DesqView aware. While I did
compile PVT100 and did use it to communicate with an HP3000
running HP-UX, I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the
emulator.

Joplin does mention in his documentation that he had a
problem with the colour routines he used. The problem did not
go away during the translation unfortunately. In the Heath 19
emulator that I eventually wrote I decided to avoid the whole
issue. The screen is not updated when colours are changed and
only new text written to the screen use the new colours.

For the most part the translation was done in a rather
mechanical fashion and the resulting code is not the best
pascal code. I believe that the pascal units correspond quite
well to Joplin's c modules except for a few routines that may
have been moved to reduce the amount of circular references
between units. I left the mutual calls between KEYIO and
VTSETUP as it looked like to much work to remove.

This is the dependancy tree of the programme.

             PVT100
             +-FILEIO (1)
             | +-DEFINES (6)
             +-COMIO (2)
             +-VIDIO (3)
             +-KEYIO (5)
             | +-VTSETUP (4)
             +-VTTIO (7)

COMIOTES.PAS is a small programme I used to debug COMIO.

PVT100 can be compiled by Turbo Pascal version 6.0. It may
not work with earlier versions because procedural types are
used.

What follows is Jerry Joplin's documentation.

Hope this is useful.
