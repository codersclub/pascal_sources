With this program you can give the basic commands to your CD-ROM player.

CD-ROM Commands Version 1.1.
With this program you can give the basic commands to your CD-ROM player.
I found a lot of programs on the net containing vga-jukeboxes for playing
and other that were memory resident but I just wanted to type 'play' for
playing and open, close and stop. The program was written in BP 7.0 (now
TP/BP 6.0+) and compiled in the real mode. There is no error handling. If
you don't hear anything, check that you have inserted an audio CD and not
a CD-ROM. I have included some batch files for easy use.
