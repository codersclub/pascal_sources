  This library was born when I had to write a program that
  required a huge amount of memory, more than 1 MB. I decided to
  use extended memory so I looked for an interface to allow me to
  access the XMS from C. I was not very satisfied with what I
  found (some libraries didn't have all the routines I needed, or
  they didn't include their full source, or they were very slow
  or difficult to use). Then I found the Lotus Intel Microsoft
  XMS specification version 3.0 and after I learned how XMS works
  I was able to write my own routines to access XMS. I grouped
  them in a library. I also wrote a Turbo Pascal unit. All the
  routines are written using the Borland C and Borland Pascal
  built-in assembler.

  Full source code (in C/C++ and Pascal) is included and also a
  demo program, a multi-target file copy utility (MDCOPY) that
  uses XMS (in C++).

  You can freely distribute the library, modify its sources or
  use it for any purpose (even include it into commercial
  products).

  If you find any bugs please report them to me.  If you use the
  library, please mention my name somewhere and let me know, so I
  can find out if this library is useful.
