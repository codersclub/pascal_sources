This text pretends explain like make programs
utilizing sprites, in the language Turbo Pascal, I wait for that
the programers of Turbo C don't have too much problems to
the hour of adapting the routines.

Practically all the games that exist in the market
they are programmed utilizing the graphic manners of the vga, but
concretely the manner 320 x 200 x 256, then well, the first
problem that we met to the hour of programming a game,
or an utility with a graphic environment is the manner of activating
this manner, we with the languages of Borland could find the
drivers that activate us the graphic manners required in
multitude of programs, but not (until the date) the manners of
256 colors in vga or svga, thanks to the shareware one can
finding some drivers thought for this in the market, I in
concrete is going to utilize the driver SVGA256.BGI of Jordan
Hargrave (Hi, Jordan:-)), in order to register to this driver as
mere you will have to pay you 20$ to the author, although also
you will elect another option, that serious activate the vga in ASM
or Assembler, this is very easy with the interruption 10h of
the bios, in this way MOV AX, 0013h, INT 10h would already have the
vga 320x200x256 activated, but we won't rely on all the
bookstore of graphics that gives with the compiler us,
although upon programming all the graphic routines in ASM
we will have something of but rapidity.


Then well, in order to activate the vga with the SVGA.BGI driver the
first that we will have to make is say you to the compiler that
this driver is not of those that the carries incorporate, or else that
it is a driver of user apart from the compiler, this will make it
with the command-&gt; like InstallUserDriver that so:
Driver:= InstallUserDriver ('SVGA256,' NIL); and then
initialicer the manner with: Initgraph (Driver,graphmode, '');
where graphmode could be an number of the 0 at 6 that they represent
all the manners of svga, we in this way will activate the svga
loading the driver svga256.bgi of the disk, but it exist a
more professional form of making this, that is include the driver
in your same program like an object, avoiding that the driver
this in an independent file, and time of access to the disk
giving it but rapidity to the program to the hour of loading, this the
we could get coverting the driver SVGA256.BGI to obj with
the command that is included with your BINOBJ compiler of
this form BINOBJ SVGA256.BGI SVGA256 SVGA256, we already have the
driver like object, later only it remain us to add this line
in our program.


For the people that are beginning them with the code
I advise that they revise the books of (Reference to the programer, Guia of the
user, Guia of the language) that they come with their compiler of Turbo Pascal,
paying attention above all in the topics related with pointers.

	 A book that also  will be very useful it is: INTERNAL PC of Michael
Tischer,  Date Becker edition, Marcombo Boixareu editors.
