            (C) Copyright 1987,1988 of FireBall Software Ltd.
            Programming, sound and graphics by Robert Schmidt
   Based on the original program for the BBC Micro by Andrew & Roger Thomas

                               INTRODUCTION :
                              ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the year 4328 after the fifth galactic war, scientists all over the planet
Zarn discovered an enormous space ship drifting seemingless without intelligent
control, outside Zarn's gravity. The III (Intergalactic Investigation
Institute) decided to send you in one of their scout ships towards the huge
aircraft.

As your scout ship fastens itself to the craft and opens a passageway between
the ships, your Life Scanner blinks wildly and says that the craft is far from
empty. It is not populated by normal life forms, but by androids, an even more
dangerous version of the Destruction robot-series! Even in your hot, airtight
space suit, you can't help feeling the ice cold fear flow slowly down your
back.

                          HOW TO REACH THE GOAL :
                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You also realize that if somebody is going to do something to save the world
Zarn from total destruction, YOU have got to do it NOW!

The scanner tells you some other valuable information : All the energy used
by the enormous ship is kept by four crystals, all locked away in separate
rooms. When (or if) you manage to get all the four crystals back to your scout
ship, the alien craft will, caused by the sudden loss of energy, self-destruct
in an enormous explosion, for never to be seen again!

To open one of those rooms, you'll need the correct electronic key.

                              POWER PACKS :
                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Scattered about in the alien craft are some very powerful packs of pure energy.
You are able to pick up and use these power packs, but you may only carry four
at a time. Use them on either the life support, the phaser or the blaster.
The life support is necessary to maintain life outside Zarn's atmosphere. If it
goes empty, you are dead.

The phaser and blaster are your two weapons. The blaster causes more damage to
the androids, but also consumes more power than the phaser. If both of your
weapons goes empty and there are no power packs available, you won't have the
slightest chance to survive the next android attack, and die.

                                THE MAP :
                               ~~~~~~~~~~~
The map of the ship is shown to the left under the main screen. It shows at all
times a map of the current level of the ship, and your position inside it.
Your own scout ship fastened itself to the ship at level two, as you can see
of the map. The two rooms marked by small 'T's at each level are teleport
rooms. Please note that objects like keys, crystals, power packs and robots are
NOT shown on the map.

Your position is shown as a room turned white. On the map you can also see the
one-door rooms, which, if they are locked, are likely to contain one of the
four crystals.

                             TELEPORT ROOMS :
                            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The only means to travel between the three levels of the ship is to enter one
of the two teleport rooms available at each level (Marked by small 'T's on the
map). You will be prompted to press a key 1-3 for the level of your wish.
If you press the number of the CURRENT level, you will be teleported to the
other teleport room at the same level.


                   FILES ON THE DISTRIBUTION DISKETTE :
                  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The following files are included on the distribution diskette :

       SPADV   .EXE       -  Version 2.01 of SPACE ADVENTURE
       HISC    .DAT       -  Hi-scores list
       SHIP    .DAT       -  The ship data, loaded for each game
       ICONS   .DAT       -  The graphics icons used in game, loaded once
       TITLE   .DAT       -  The title screens, loaded at start-up only

       INSTR   .EXE       -  To read this documentation
       SPADV   .DOC       -  This file

If SPADV can't find SHIP, ICONS or TITLE.DAT the program will return you to
DOS with an error message. The same happens if INSTR can't find this
documentation file. If HISC.DAT is not present, SPADV will generate a new
hi-scores list at startup.

In case any of the important files are missing, contact the person you got your
copy from for an update. If that doesn't help, send $20 and a diskette to the
address at the end of these instructions for the latest version of the game.
