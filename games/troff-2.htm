              Written with Borland's Turbo Pascal 5.5

                          Excuse my comparatively bad English,
                          I'm just a beginner. (In any case,
                          You won't understand my excellent
                          Russian!)

     GAME REQUIREMENTS:
        1. AT-286
        2. EGA 256k (640 X 350, 16 colours)
        3. DOS 3.30 or higher

     Have You ever played TROFF ?  If not,  see PsL July  1990
Games disk #2. But here is the latest version of this game -
TROFF - 2 which gives You some new rules,  more  sophisticated
EGA 256k graphics and excellent BOSS key (pause for laugh -
don't use it often !) and, of course, more challenge.
     Someone can ask me:
     - This is merely old SNAKE game from ISKRA-226 -
       the best of IBM-noncompatible computers... (why not?)
     or:
     - This is BLOCKADE from ATARI-800XL computer... (maybe)
     or:
     - Hell only knows what it is !!!  (you're right!)
     But I'm not sure that it's so bad.  Because it is known,
that simple games are often very playable. You can notice that
the game environment is much better than the  game  itself.  I
will agree  with  You,  because TROFF - 2 is a good example of
some features of excellent  Turbo  Pascal  graphics  with  the
combination of the weak sense of humour.
     Thus, give up your work, turn your TV and VCR off and run
TROFF.EXE!
     The first thing You see will be S.I.B. - the official UFP
sign - not very nice but absolutely necessary. Stare at it as
long as you want, then press Space Bar. Now You will see the
beautiful colourful Title Screen with the title - 'TROFF II'.
Press Space Bar again and The Game Options Screen will appear.
     On the top you can notice the Game Title (so you'll never
forget it!) and also High and Low Scores (in green or in red,
depends on  who  has  reached  them  -  you  or  mr.Troff /the
computer/). Use ARROWS to change options  or press ENTER to
start (or to quit) the game. The options are:
     TURNS TO WIN - number of turns you need to win for
                    completing the game (up to 12)
     ENEMY SNAKE ON/OFF - Turn it off if you merely want to
                          check your SNAKE skills or turn
                          it on to play TROFF-2 itself
     MOVING WALLS - This is the new feature in compare of
                    TROFF-1. 4 levels (OFF/EASY/MED./HARD)
                    are possible
     MAX.SNAKE LENGTH (100/150/200) - Length, which your
                    snake (green) must reach to win a turn
     SPEED - Speed of the game (from VERY SLOW to MADNESS)
     SOUND - Toggles sound on/off
     START GAME + press ENTER
     QUIT       +    here

PLAYING THE GAME
     You control the Green Snake, the computer controls the Red one.
     When a snake meets any wall on its way, it begins to reduce
     the length, and finally it  disappears (losing turn).
     There are also some useful objects which you might
     catch - The White Star, The Blue Star and Yellow S.I.B. (UFP
     sign).
     WHITE STAR gives Your snake 2, 4, 6 or 8 items of
                length (this depends on the size of a star)
     BLUE STAR gives You 20, 40, 60 or 80 points of score.
     S.I.B. gives 10 items of length and 100 score points,
            but it moves randomly all the time that's why catching
            it is a real problem.

     Use following keys to control your snake:

     ARROWS     Move snake up, down, left or right
                (Remember, you can't move backwards!)
     F1         Pause Game. Press F4 to continue
     F2         Toggles Sound On/Off
     F3         Boss Key (!)
     F10        Exit to the Game Options Menu

SCORE BOARD is to the right side of the screen
     It shows  the number of turns won by you or by mr.Troff (on
the top), score (on the bottom) and current snakes' length
(two 3D bars in the middle of the score board). There are also
three lights: one on the bottom indicates who has the greater
score, two on the top light when one of the players has only
one turn to complete the game. At least, when the sound is on
a small note icon appears in the top right corner.

     That's all about the game. Have a nice Troff!</PRE>
