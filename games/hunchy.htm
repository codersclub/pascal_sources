<TR><TD colspan=3><PRE><p style="margin-left:50px">This is a game I wrote back in the eighties - the tender, golden
age of PC's.  Actually, "Hunchback" is a conversion of an even
older favourite of mine on the BBC 'B' Micro.

If you are familiar with the original, you'll feel right at home,
as I made this conversion as true to it as possible.  A couple of
things:

 * Hunchback will be very fast on today's PCs, so you'll want
	 to slow your 486, and yes, even your 386SX/16, down a lot.
 * Nothing less than CGA supported ... uhmm... nothing more either,
	 in fact... :-)
 * Don't be alarmed if some noises come out of your speaker.  I
	 didn't own a sound card back then, but I did my best with what
	 I had...

This, sources and all, is Public Domain as far as I am concerned.
Nothing at all was ripped from the original, and I doubt anyone
would care to push a "look-and-feel" lawsuit over me on this... :-)

By the way: GREDIT3.PAS is the editor I wrote to do the CGA graphics.
Simple, but good enough at the time.  If you ever edit one of the
images, run I.BAT to update the image collection used by the
game.  WALLS.TXT describes all the walls, you should be able to
figure it out from the comments and from the sources.  Feel free to
play around with it, but run WALLC.PAS to update the "compiled"
version used by the game.

If you like Hunchback, send a colorful, fun postcard to
