The DeZip program included in this package is a Turbo Pascal (v5.0)
implementation of a decompressor for ZIP format archives created with
PKWare's PKZIP program.

The syntax for the DeZip program is:

   DeZip [d:][\path\]zipname[.zip] [d:][\outpath] [filespec [...]]

where 'zipname' is the name of the ZIP file from which members are
to be extracted, 'outpath' is the name of a subdirectory into which
all extracted members will be placed, and 'filespec' represents a DOS
file specification (wildcards are allowed) limiting the extraction
to one or more matching file names.

The only command line parameter that is required is the name of the
ZIP file to be processed.  If no filename extension is supplied,
'.ZIP' is assumed.  If no outpath is specified, the current
drive/subdirectory will be used.  If no filespec(s) are entered,
'*.*' will be assumed.

Examples:

 *  Extract all '.pas' files from the OneFile.Zip archive.
    Place each extracted member into the subdirectory e:\work:

               DeZip OneFile.Zip e:\work *.pas

 *  Extract all files from the OneFile.Zip archive.  Place all
    extracted members into the current subdirectory:

               DeZip OneFile
