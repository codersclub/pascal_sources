    Usage:  Crunch outputfile[.arc] [inputfile [...]]

  Purpose:  Create archive files using LZW 12-bit compression
            that are compatible with those produced by PKWare and
            SEA programs.


Program Notes:

*  This program does NOT update or freshen an archive.  It can
   only be used to create NEW archives!

*  If no input file specifications are provided on the command
   line, the program assumes *.*

*  Only two stowage methods are supported by this program...they
   are

    Crunching:  Input is first "packed" to remove repeated
                character sequences and is then compressed using
                12-bit LZW compression techniques.  Adaptive
                resets of the algorithm's code table may also be
                utilized.

      Storing:  The input file is copied into the archive with no
                compression applied.

*  Files will be "stored" in the resulting archive if the
   program's crunching routine does not produce a smaller result.

*  13-bit "squashing" has not been implemented in this program.
   It has been left as an exercise for the student (see the file
   Squash.How for some hints on how to proceed).

*  I originally wanted to release full Turbo Pascal source code
   for the program.  Unfortunately, the "all TP" version was
   slower than mollasses on a cold day.  I therefore re-coded
   several routines within the program using inline assembler.
   The asm stuff is heavily commented, but if it still looks like
   gobbledygook to you, I apologize.  The intent was to release
   this package as both an educational tool and as a program that
   did useful work.  The only way that the second objective could
   be realized was to replace certain critical routines with
   something a little faster than what the TP compiler could
   provide.

*  Be careful...this TP 5.0 program was compiled with the "force
   far calls" option turned ON.  The inline routines rely on this
   fact. If you compile with this option turned OFF, the results
   will be unpredictable.

*  The author of the programs contained within CRUNCH10.ARC makes
   no claim as to the correctness or suitability of these
   programs for any particular purpose whatsoever.  If you use
   these programs or the algorithms from which they were derived,
   you must assume all responsibility for the consequences of
   that use.

*  The routines presented in Crunch.Pas were derived from the
   lzcomp.asm and lzdcmp.asm programs written and released by Tom
   Pfau back in 1985.  The programs in this archive are
   yours...do with them what you will, but please note that
   System Enhancements Associates (SEA) regards ARC as their
   trademark.  Should you wish to use the Crunch source code in
   your own program, I suggest you contact SEA for licensing
   details and restrictions.  I WILL NOT ACCEPT any
   responsibility for any legal problems that may arise as a
   result of the use or misuse of the ARC processing code
   contained in Crunch.  I do not have any agreement myself with
   SEA;  SEA has indicated that public domain programs may
   process .ARC files without any restrictions.
