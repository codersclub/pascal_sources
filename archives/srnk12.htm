The Shrink program included in this package is a Turbo Pascal (v5.0)
implementation of a ZIP archive maker.  The archives produced by the
Shrink program are compatible with those created by PKWare's PKZIP
program.

At this time, only two of the six compression methods used by PKZIP
have been implemented.  Input files are compressed using the
"shrinking" method. If shrinking does not produce a file smaller than
the original, the input file will be "stored" into the ZIP archive
with no compression applied.

The syntax for the Shrink program is:

   Shrink [d:][\path\]zipname[.zip] [[d:][\path\]filespec [...]]

where 'zipname' is the name of the ZIP file to be created, and
'filespec' epresents a DOS file specification (wildcards are allowed)
limiting the files to be included in the archive.

The only command line parameter that is required is the name of the
ZIP file to be processed.  If no filename extension is supplied,
'.ZIP' is assumed.  If no outpath is specified, the current
drive/subdirectory will be used. If no filespec(s) are entered,
'*.*' will be assumed.

Examples:

*  Create a ZIP archive called OneFile.Zip that contains all '.pas'
   files in the subdirectory e:\work:

               Shrink OneFile.Zip e:\work\*.pas

*  Create a ZIP archive called OneFile.Zip that contains all files in
   the current subdirectory:

               Shrink OneFile
