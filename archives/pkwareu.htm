Version    1.0a  October 1993.

  For Borland Turbo Pascal Version 5.5, may not work with other
  versions.

BACKGROUND

  This unit came out of a need to access files inside zipped files
  in another program which I was writing at the time.  I have tested it
  with version 1 and 2 of PKZIP'd files, and it seems to work correctly.

PURPOSE

  Very simply, to allow us Turbo Pascal programmers access to
  the details, not the compressed data, inside PKWARE's zipped
  archives.

USE

  Use as you would any other Pascal unit.

  Several routines are available for you to use.  I limited the
  number for call-able routines so the information would not be
  overwhelming.  I hope you find these routines usfeul, considering
  the limited scope of this unit.

  Please note that in these routines I do very little in the way of
  heap checking and IO errors.  I did this for two reasons.  First
  it allows YOU the freedom to handle erros as YOU wish, not as I would
  have you deal with them.  Second. I find that there are already
  many good tools to aid Pascal programers, but functinality reduced
  due to someone else adding fruitless robustness, which only adds
  program bulk and slowing exicution speed  (TechnoJocks Turbo Toolbox
  comes to mind).

  NOTE: You are responsible for opening and closing the ZIP File.
  It must be assigned to the File variable "Zipfile", which is
  declared in the interface of the PKwareU.  See the demos for
  how this is done.


TYPES, VARS, and CONSTS

  See PKWAREU.INC for details of types used.  If you have the
  source code you can actually change them!

CONTACT

  If you would like the source code to this unit please contact me.
  I charge a small fee for my time, and do not want the code
  released to the public domain.

  You can use the unit "as is" in any program donated to the pubic
  domain! We will discuss PKWAREU uses in programs for money
  (shareware or business ventures) if you contact me.
