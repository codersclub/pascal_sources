'UnZip' is a small Zipfile extract utility.   It is written to be as
small and portable as possible -- ideal as a starting point for handling
.ZIP files in non-IBM environments.

Source code is provided in C and Turbo Pascal.  If you port this program
to a non-IBM system, I would appreciate a copy of the ported source and
exec files.


Usage
-----
   unz filename[.zip]           ;pascal language version
   unzip filename[.zip]         ;C language version


Revision history
----------------

3-3-89
   Initial alpha test release.

3-5-89
   First fully operational release.  Does not implement CRC verification,
   but should correctly unzip all compression methods.

3-6-89
   Corrected end-of-file detection in both shrink and reduce expanders.
   Resulting files should now always have the correct size.  Added ".ZIP"
   default to unzip.c to match calling conventions of unz.pas.

3-8-89
   Moved machine and operating-system specific code to a block starting
   around line 180.  Added code to swap bytes on host machines that
   store the high order bytes in lower address locations than the low
   order bytes.

3-15-89
   Added CRC checking in UNZIP.C.  Speeded operation by about 150%.

   I'm spending my time on the C version now and don't plan to do any
   further work on the pascal.  If you're using the pascal version
   please contact me.

9-9-89
   Addition of new "un-implode" logic to handle new compression format
   included with PKZ101.

4-5-90
   Modifications to the Turbo Pascal version by John A. McKown .
   CompuServe ID 72325,1705. These modifications are NOT supported by
   Samuel Smith! 1. Added CRC checking. 2. Decreased average elapsed
   time by around 35 percent. This was done by performance analysis
   done with HotSpotter Version 5.50 by 3QC. Available from The
   Programmer's Connection. Yes - this was a mini-ad. HotSpotter is
   GREAT!
   Mr. Smith's original code is still in this package by his request.
