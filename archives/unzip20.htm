'UnZip' is a small Zipfile extract utility.   It is written to be
as small and portable as possible -- ideal as a starting point
for handling .ZIP files in non-IBM environments.

Source code is provided in C and Turbo Pascal.  If you port this
program to a non-IBM system, I would appreciate a copy of the
ported source and exec files.


Usage
-----
   unz filename[.zip]           ;pascal language version
   unzip filename[.zip]         ;C language version


Revision history
----------------

3-3-89
   Initial alpha test release.

3-5-89
   First fully operational release.  Does not implement CRC
   verification, but should correctly unzip all compression
   methods.

3-6-89
   Corrected end-of-file detection in both shrink and reduce
   expanders.  Resulting files should now always have the correct
   size.  Added ".ZIP" default to unzip.c to match calling
   conventions of unz.pas.

3-8-89
   Moved machine and operating-system specific code to a block
   starting around line 180.  Added code to swap bytes on host
   machines that store the high order bytes in lower address
   locations than the low order bytes.

3-15-89
   Added CRC checking in UNZIP.C.  Speeded operation by about
   150%.

   I'm spending my time on the C version now and don't plan to do
   any further work on the pascal.  If you're using the pascal
   version please contact me.

9-9-89
   Addition of new "un-implode" logic to handle new compression
   format included with PKZ101.
