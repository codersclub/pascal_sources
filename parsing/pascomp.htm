INTRODUCTION

   Facilis is a p-code compiler for an extended subset of the Pascal
programming language.  It is based on the Pascal S compiler of Niklaus Wirth.
It was adapted for the IBMPC by John R. Naleszkiewicz, and is being extended
by Anthony M. Marcy.  It is in the public domain.
   Facilis is written in Pascal and can be compiled by the Turbo Pascal
compiler sold by Borland International.  It cannot compile itself.
For details on how to compile the Facilis source code, see the implementation
manual (file FACILIS.IMP).
   This manual tells you how to run Facilis and describes its features and
limitations.  Knowledge of standard Pascal is assumed; hence emphasis here
will be on deviations from the standard.
   Version 0.20 has been modified with some InLine assembly code to speed
up run time execution.  This has reduced the portability of the source code
to other machines.

The compiler adheres closely to the standard Pascal of Jensen and Wirth.
However, file I/O is not yet implemented, and there are some other limitations.
See the Users Manual for details.

   FACILIS.UM   -  Users Manual - extensions, limitations, error codes -
                      You need this to run programs under Facilis.
