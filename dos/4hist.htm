4HIST removes all superfluous lines from the current 4DOS command history
list.  A tiny batch file is included to automate processing.

Usage: 4HIST file [/i (ignore case)]

4HIST can be run from the command line or via a batch file (4H.BTM is
included for this purpose).

4HIST takes one or two parameters.  The first must be the name of the file
containing the command history list.  You can produce this file in 4DOS by
entering:  HISTORY &gt;file  (use "HISTORY /R file" to read the list back into
memory).

The second parameter is optional.  It is a slash followed by the letter
"i" or "I".  This parameter instructs 4HIST to ignore case when
determining duplicates, which slows 4HIST down considerably.  Default is
to only recognize -exact- duplicates.

See the included batch file 4H.BTM for an example of how to use 4HIST.

4HIST provides some basic information about the data being processed:

1) It displays a "twirling bar" which pulses once for each command entry
   processed.  The faster the bar twirls, the faster 4HIST is working.
2) When done, it tells how many commands existed prior to processing, and
   how many exist afterwards.
3) When done, it tells how many bytes the commands used in the 4DOS memory
   allocation before processing, and how many they will use afterwards.
   NOTE: this figure is -not- the same as the file size.  This is because
   in a file, both a carriage return -and- a line feed are appended to
   each line, but in RAM, only one is needed.


NOTE: This program may work, with modifications, with other command
      history programs. I can not, and probably will not, test it.
      However, if you can and do, I would appreciate hearing how it
      performs.  I will distribute any modified copies you send me
      (on disk or simply a printed source listing).
