   ANSI Alternate to CRT unit}

   attribute changes, etc., and Interrupt 21h DOS calls for
   everything else. No ROM BIOS calls at all.
   Should work on any MS-DOS computer with ANSI support.}
(*******************************************************************)
{ The variable TextAttr is maintained, although not used.
  Just for the curious. It serves no purpose. The variable CheckBreak
  is supported.
  None of the other variables are supported, as almost all have to do
  with various aspects of direct screen writing, which is not supported.

  None of the Crt Mode constants are supplied.  All of the Text Color
  constants are supported.

  It is possible to do much more with ANSI actually, than with many of
  Turbo's standard CRT procedures, but no extras were implemented, in
  the interest of compatibility with Turbo.

  There is one major limitation.  The window procedure is not supported.
  In the interest of universal compatibility Textmode is also not
  supported, although it could be.

  The following CRT unit functions and procedures are supported as
  follows:
    AssignCrt      :   Not supported
    ClrEol         :   Fully supported
    ClrScr         :   Fully supported
    Delay          :   Not supported
    DelLine        :   Not supported
                       (Could easily be, but never used it)
    GotoXY         :   Fully supported
    HighVideo      :   Fully supported
    InsLine        :   Not Supported    (See DelLine)
    LowVideo       :   Fully supported
    NoSound        :   Not supported
    Sound          :   Not supported
    TextBackground :   Fully supported
    TextColor      :   Fully supported
    TextMode       :   Not supported
    Window         :   Not supported
    KeyPressed     :   Fully supported
    NormVideo      :   Fully supported
    ReadKey        :   Fully supported
    WhereX         :   Fully supported
    WhereY         :   Fully supported

 Those miscellaneous functions which are not supported are almost
 all available in Carley Phillip's CRTI unit, available in this DL
 as CRTI.ARC. Combine some of these and some of those in one unit
 if you need the Sound, NoSound, Delay, etc. If you do this however,
 you will lose some of the MS-DOS generic nature of these routines,
 which depend only on DOS and ANSI, and require no IBM compatibility.
 Under NO circumstances may this unit be used in combination with the
 standard CRT unit. It is a replacement. The Graph, Graph3 and Turbo3
 units are not compatible with this unit and should not be used either.

 This unit supplies one unit not available in CRT, the GetKey function.
 Most of the time I just want a character returned. I am not interested
 in function keys, etc.  GetKey does just that.  It first flushes the
 keyboard, in case you accidentally pressed something, ignores function
 keys, and returns the value of the keypress as a character. Where the
 variable ch is a character, the appropriate syntax would be:
    ch := GetKey;
 It will then wait for the key.

        This program is dedicated to the public domain.
        No copyright is claimed.
        I would be interested in reports.
