OVERVIEW

    ANSIView is a unit that will give you the features that you came
    to enjoy from the CRT unit with the earlier versions of Turbo
    Pascal while still retaining the features of the new TVISION
    enviroment. ANSIView provides a single object that will give you
    the ability to open a "CRT" window on your desktop and interface
    with it exactly as you would with a "normal" pascal program.


USAGE

    To use this with your program, you will be setting it up exactly
    as you would a normal window. That is, you need to initialize it
    with certain parameters and insert it into your desktop chain and
    you need to dispose of the window when you are done.

If you have any questions or if you have suggestions (definatly if you
have suggestions!) you can get in contact with me at one of the
following...

Note:  I will be leaving for Saudi Arabia March '91 (Yes, I'm in the
       Army. I'm a Tank Platoon Leader) so if you have any instant
       pressing questions, I'd recommend getting them in before then
       as having my mail forwarded overseas and back again after that
       might just get you a LONG response time.  But keep on trying.
       I have no idea when I'll be back from the dessert.
       Might just come home early!
