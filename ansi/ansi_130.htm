Musica v1.00 (c) CopyRight 1990 P.H.Rankin Hansen.

The  PingAnsi  unit  provides  partial  Ansi  emulation for Turbo
Pascal  versions  5.x  and  higher.  (version  4 does not support
procedural types). Some routines may be handled in a non-standard
way.

The Musica unit implements the Play statement known from Basic.

Released in Denmark on June 3rd 1990.

                        Acknowlegdements:

The  text file  device driver  mechanism was  suggested by Robert
Mashlan.

The so called 'Ansi'-music is due to steady prompting and lots of
small hints from Dan Wulff, Dragons Lair (2:231/57.0)

In creating the  units I have used Turbo  Pascal 5.5 Professional
(Borland),  Turbo  Analyst  5.04  and  Turbo Professional Toolbox
5.07 (Turbo Power).

The units were  written to end the steady  stream of questions in
the  international  Pascal  echo  about  how  to  implement  Ansi
emulation with turbo Pascal. Sofar it looks like it has increased
the number.



                         Using the units:

(This is a preliminary document and NOT complete ! )

First  let  me  make  one  thing  prefectly  clear.  If You issue
grabtimer function in  the Musica unit, the 8253  timer 0 will be
re-programmed to a 1 ms period. Therefore Interrupt 8 occurs 1000
times a second  instead of 18.2 times. The  original interrupt is
called only once every 55  interrupts and the system is therefore
operating like usual. If You  have other routines that re-program
timer 0 the result will propably be less than impressing. Keep in
mind that problems may also occur  if a TSR with memory-swap pops
up on top  of the interrupt handler. You  can normalize the timer
and release the interrupt using the procedure ReleaseTimer.

First  You have  to decide  how You  are going  to use the units.
There are three conditionals (Small,  BBS and, Music) that govern
the function of PingAnsi.

The  conditional  'Small'  defines  wether  the  Text File device
driver should be included. The  Device driver will  be slower for
single  characters, but  presumably  faster  for strings.  If You
define  'Small' the  driver part   will be  left out.  Wether You
include  the  text  file  driver  will  have  NO influence on the
AnsiWrite function, only on the size of the compiled unit.

The  conditional  'BBS'  defines  wether  the  hook BBSHook(Char)
should be called as well as AnsiWrite during writes. Use this for
echoing all Write(Ansi,......) to e.g. the ComPort or a log file.

The  conditional 'Music'  defines wether  the Ansi  parser should
check for so called Ansi music. Please note that this is NOT part
of the Ansi  specs., but the name sticks and  I have been _asked_
to implement  it. I have  interfaced the procedure  PlayHook(St :
String) wich, using the Musica unit, can be used to implement the
Play  statement  known  from  Basic.  Musica  supports background
buffering of music.



                             HOOKS:

Several hooks besides BBSHook are implemented.

ReplyHook     : Procedure(St : String);

ReplyHook  is  a  hook  for  implementing  Your own Device Status
Report  procedure. It  defaults to  a procedure  that places  the
response in  the keyboard buffer,  but can be  redirected to e.g.
sending the report to the comport.

  KeyHook     : Procedure(St : String);

KeyHook   is  a   hook   for   implementing  Your   own  KeyBoard
Re-assignment. You could  use this in a comms.  program to report
attempts to re-assign Your keyboard.

  WriteHook   : Procedure(Ch : Char);

WriteHook is a Hook for handling control chars i.e. Ord(Ch) &lt; $20

  PlayHook : Procedure(Tone, Duration : word);

This hook is for implementing 'Ansi' music.



                           VARIABLES:

Several variables have been interfaced:

Ansi is the name of the Text file device driver.

Wrap is  set to true  if cursor should  wrap at the  screen edge.
Defaults to true.

ReportedX are ReportedY the reported  cursor location issued by a
parsed  position  report.  i.e.  if  the  string  #27[#;#R is run
through the parser.



                    PROCEDURES AND FUNCTIONS:

Procedure AnsiWrite(Ch : Char);

This is the main routine.

Function In_Ansi : Boolean;

Returns true if a ansi sequence is pending.

Procedure AssignAnsi(Var f : Text);

This is used like AssignCrt. It  resets the driver. The driver is
automatically assigned  to the file  Ansi at startup,  but You're
the boss...

You handle the Text file device driver like any other write:

Write(Ansi,whatever....



                             Musica:

This unit can be used as a  standalone unit as it does not depend
on the PingAnsi unit.

Const
  WaitForEmpty : boolean = True;

Governs the  behavior of the  procedure that places  the motes in
the background buffer. If set to true and the PlayBuffer is full,
stuff  will wait  until space  is awailable  before returning. If
false and the PlayBuffer is full, stuff will discard the note and
return (buffer overrun).

Procedure Play(St : String);

Implements the parsing of the play strings.

Function PlayBufferEmpty : boolean;

Returns true if the background buffer  is empty. You can use this
to prevent certain  events from taking place until  the music has
finished.

e.g.

                While Not PlayBufferEmpty do {};
                Exit;

Function PlayBufferFull : boolean;

Returns true if  the background buffer is Full.  You can use this
to  prevent  buffer  overrun  (if  WaitForEmpty  is  false) or to
prevent  the  system  from  beeing  'locked'  (if WaitForEmpty is
True).

Function GrabTimer : Boolean;

Installs the background handler and sets up ExitProc to unload it
upon exit. If  it returns false the handler  was not instaled due
to an incompatible timer mode.

Procedure ReleaseTimer;

Uninstalls the background handler.
