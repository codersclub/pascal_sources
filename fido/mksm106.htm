         v1.06 12/10/94

               + Added ReReadIdx function to JAM to reduce code
                 size (was repeated in several areas) (thanks to
                 Thomas Antepoth @2:2487/8086 for noticing this)

               - Now set HdrLoc in JAM index to -1 when a message
                 is deleted

               + Added GetHighActiveMsg function so that highest
                 active message number is available
                 (for Brent Shellenberg @ 1:140/146)

               + Added IsValidAddr function to MKGlobT to ease
                 checking addresses (from a suggestion by
                 Matej Miheli~ @ 2:380/103.2)

               - Fixed Hudson delete msg to properly update number
                 of msgs (changed OR to AND when checking if it
                 was already deleted) (thanks to Patrick Riley
                 @ 1:247/129 for reporting this)

               - Changed get number of msgs in Hudson to return
                 number of msg in area instead of number of msgs
                 in msg base.  (suggested by Patrick Riley also)

               - Fixed bug in getstring method of *.Msg for
                 messages larger than 64k (switched from
                 word to longint) (thanks to Jonas Eckerman
                 at 2:201/623 for catching this one and also
                 for suggestions on improving speed, some of
                 which are not implemented yet)

               + Changed GetString in *.Msg to get a block from
                 the MKFFile buffer at a time to improve processing
                 speed (this one I thought of!)

               - Fixed bug in deleting msgs in JAM areas (wasn't
                 rewriting the msghdr to disk) (thanks to Vadim
                 Rumyantsev @ 2:5030/48 for spotting this)

               - Fixed bug in no-kludge-line get string (thanks
                 to Vadim Rumyantsev@2:5030/48 for catching this
                 one)

               + Added prescan to *.Msg to significantly improve
                 speed in *.Msg areas (also RESCAN method to allow
                 for updates) (several people made suggestions for
                 this one, although I ended up taking a slightly
                 different approach to implement it)

               - Fixed INTL kludge lines in *.msg areas to
                 ignore points (thanks to Ron Huiskes @2:281/506
                 for spotting this one)

               - Added return value to open of *.msg area

               - Fixed bug in MKFile GetTempName routine that
                 resulted in the temp file not being closed

               - Added code to prevent setting TOPT and FMPT kludge
                 lines for *.Msg and Hudson unless the message type
                 is Netmail

         v1.05 03/20/94

               + Changed name to MK Source for Messages (archive
                 name MKSM???.*) to reduce confusion with a similar
                 named Make Message utility by another author)

               + Changed "FileError" to "MKFileError" in MKFile unit
                 to reduce conflict with other libraries that
                 also used a "FileError" variable

               - Fixed bug in Hudson msg object so that messages
                 exceeding the maximum message size it handles are
                 now truncated
                 (thanks to Mark Lewis for catching this one)

               - Fixed bug in "yournext" routine in Hudson msg base
                 (read sizeof(yourarray) instead of "yoursize")
                 (finally a bug that showed up in my own testing &lt;grin&gt;)

               - Fixes to MKFFile to improve effeciency by reducing
                 writes to the file

               - Fixed serious error in detecting Hudson and
                 Ezycom message bases.  OpenOrCreate would not see
                 the message base and re-create it (overwriting the
                 old one!)

               - Improved ParseAddr to ignore @domain information
                 when parsing zone, net, node, point fields
                 (thanks to Ryan Murray at 1:153/942)

               - Fixed value returned by WriteMsg for Ezycom
                 message object (thanks to Mark Lewis)

               + Added GetNoKludgeStr method to allow ^A kludge
                 lines to be ignored while retreiving text
                 {thanks to Johan Corstjens 2:281/610}

               + Added capability to create directories so that
                 the CreateMsgBase function will now create
                 subdirectories as needed


         v1.04 01/09/94

               + Major changes to the *.Msg routines to allow it
                 to handle virtually unlimited message size with
                 reasonable speed

               + Changed default in MKB.Def to use BASM interrupts
                 under Windows

               - Fixed dropping character on JAM subbuf characters
                 (array should start at 0)   (Thanks to Frank
                 Van.Der.Ham 2:285/630.3 for noticing this and the
                 following fix)

               - Fixed JAM writeidx to only write the amount that
                 had been read

               + Added support for NextSeeAlso for JAM (using
                 suggestion provided by Jonas Eckerman 2:201/623)

               - Fixed seekprior in JAM format to avoid GPF when
                 compiled for Windows (thanks to Ton Van Den Broek
                 2:2802/122)


         v1.03 11/21/93

               - Fixed handling of JAM lastread pointers

               + Added reading JAM msg kludge lines

               - Fixed handling of message deletes in JAM

               - Fixed bug that caused some kludge lines to be
                 missed in *.Msg messages


         v1.02 08/15/93

               + Added support for JAM message bases


         v1.01 ??/??/??

               + Added support for Ezycom message bases


         v1.00 ??/??/??

               + MKMsgSrc released with support for Hudson,
                 Squish, and *.Msg message formats</PRE>
