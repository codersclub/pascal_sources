  -------------------------------[  USAGE  ]------------------------------

        The included programs make up a library of routines to allow you
    to easily access various message base types in a very generic manner.
    (I am hopeful that others will extend this to include even more
    message base types).  To accomplish this a generic AbsMsgObj was created
    and the Hudson, JAM, Squish, *.Msg, and Ezy objects were descended from it.

    In the MKMsgAbs.Pas file there are comments which explain what the various
    methods were intended to accomplish.

    To write new messages to the message bases, you need to be sure to call
    StartNewMsg prior to setting any of the message fields or adding any
    text.  Text may be added to the message via DoChar, DoString, and
    DoStringLn calls.  When the message is finished call WriteMsg to save
    the message to the message base (nothing is updated until this is done).

    The various methods you can call are explained further in the sections
    below, marked "Reading Messages" and "Writing Messages".  You also
    may want to examine the included sample applications (MsgExprt, MsgImprt,
    and MKMsgCvt to see how they used the message objects).

    If anyone develops support for added message base formats, that you
    will make freely available (for any purpose) to other developers,
    please contact me about including it in a future release.  The
    advantage to BBS developers is that this will make it very easy for
    utility authors to support your message base format.


  --------------------------[  Examples Included  ]------------------------


    MsgExprt - Exports a message area to a text file

    MsgImprt - Imports a text file into a message base.

    MKMsgCvt - Converts (copies) messages from one msg base to another
