(* 'timestamp' fields that indicate when a message was            *)
(* created and when it arrived on the system and in the use       *)
(* of certain message flags.  The extended use of the flags       *)
(* is done in such a way as to only be of use within the          *)
(* Opus environment and avoidsconflict with other systems         *)
(* which adhere to basic FidoNet standards.                       *)
(* In a manner directly descended from the original Fido&lt;tm&gt;      *)
(* BBS system, messages are stored in one or more directories     *)
(* which each correspond to a System Area (topic).                *)
(* Each message is stored in its own file and has a file name     *)
(* format "#.MSG" where "#" is the assigned number of the         *)
(* message. The first messages in any given area would be         *)
(* named 1.MSG, 2.MSG, and so on.                                 *)

(* Each message file consists of a fixed-length header record,    *)
(* immediately followed by a variable-length stream of ASCII      *)
(* text that is terminated by an ASCII NULL (Code 0).             *)
(* All text is considered to be unformatted and continuous        *)
(* without end-of-line sequences unless they are meant to         *)
(* unconditionally force a new paragraph.  Traditionally,         *)
(* some message editors and BBS's use a  $8D character            *)
(* (CR with 8th bit ON) as a "soft" carriage return.              *)
(* These should be treated as superfluous *unless" they are       *)
(* immediately followed by a space.  In that case, the line       *)
(* that the space starts is considered to be fixed format and     *)
(* should not be word wrapped as all other message text will be.  *)
(* The header data contains fixed information about the author,   *)
(* addressee, creation and arrival dates, subject, message        *)
(* numbers that it replies to or is answered by, privacy flags,   *)
(* and so on.  In the case of messages in a netmail area,         *)
(* there are many special flags used.                             *)

(*  The following _stamp structure is used in Opus message        *)
(*  headers to store a message's creation date (when first        *)
(*  written) and the date the message arrived on the system       *)

(*  This dating information is auxiliary and used by Opus only.   *)
(*  It does *not* replace the functionality of the FTSC           *)

(*  by Opus for compatibility with the rest of the world.         *)
