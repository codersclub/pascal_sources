   Introduction
   ------------

   This unit is an interface to a comunication way used on some LAN systems
   called NetBios. As far as I know, the only system on which NetBios is not
   built in, is NOVEL, but there is a small utility that comes with Novel
   to give it the NetBios support.

   So, why do I need to comunicate using netbios, if I can simply write to the
   remote's Disk ??  well, I asked myself the same question some time ago, and
   decided to try. I wrote a program the sent pages after a request was recived
   from a remote. the request was written to the host's ramdisk, and the reply
   was written there as well, and read by the remote. it took about 1 sec. for
   the screen to be transfered (It takes some time for the host to prepair the
   screen).
   After I rewritten the program using this NetBios interface, I could send
   about 5 screens per sec !

   I have used CBIS's Netbios text file documentation to learn about NetBios.
   I have included the COMPLETE package of CBIS's text file with no changes
   to the text. That text file is copyrighted by them , and is only added
   here to make it easier for you to find it. it is not a part of my work.


   This Interface represents many hours of work, and of "why for god's sake
   does'nt it work ???" so  if you decide to use this Interface in your
   programs, please send your contributions to me.
   Anything more then 5 USD will do. Please note that if you send a cheque,
   then sending less then 10 USD will most likely cost me more then the
   cheque's value itself !

   Please post your contributions to :
