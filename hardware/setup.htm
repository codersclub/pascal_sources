         Notes:
         1) This program is in the public domain.  The version upon which
         it is based was originally placed in the Public Domain by Bob
         Kamins and Tyler Ivanco.

         2) The hard disk descriptions are generated by reading the table
         in ROM, and so some entries may be different from machine to
         machine (IBM has a standard set for types 1-23).  You may now set
         any drive type up to # 255; I doubt that any machine actually has
         a table this large so you'll probably find garbage in some of
         these positions.  (You'll also notice that you can't set type 15;
         this is not a valid drive type)

         3)  3.5" drives are now supported.  You will also find type '# 5'
         through '# 15' available in a bid for future compatibility.

         4) Display cards which install their own BIOS (eg, the EGA and VGA
         cards) are now supported.  Set EGA/VGA for *any* card which
         installs its own BIOS.

         5) You will be warned if any of the CMOS error flags are set;  The
         possible errors include: Battery is dead, Clock has lost power
         (these are NOT the same), RAM checksum is bad, configuration is
         bad, memory size is wrong, either hard disk failed to initialize,
         or time is incorrect.  Note that some of these are maintained by
         the BIOS as part of the power-on test; they may only be correct
         after a cold reboot ('Battery dead' is always correct).

         6) The system clock is updated every time you change one of the
         time or date fields.  The CMOS clock is only updated if you save
         the new configuration at the end.  The 'Stand by--Setting clock'
         message means the program is waiting to sync with a whole second
         to set the clock as accurately as possible. ( Unfortunately, DOS
         isn't as picky.  You may find your system clock 1-2 seconds slow
         the next time you boot).

         7) Features added from the original version:
         *      The day of the week is now displayed.  It is maintained by
                the BIOS and can't be directly changed, so if your BIOS
                can't handle leap years don't blame me. :-)
         *      The value of 100ths of seconds is displayed (because it's
                there, that's why!).  Again, it can't be changed directly.
         *      You can synchronize the clock with the 0 key, no matter
                which field you're on.  Synchronizing the clock sets it
                backward to the last whole second, so you may have to
                fiddle with it a bit.
         *      When finished, you will be asked whether to save the
                configuration or not.
         *      The executable is around 9k smaller, and much faster.

         8) Features added from version 2.0 (some are noted above):
         *      Warning screen on configuration errors.
         *      Corrected a bug in which the display was not restored
                properly on exit (that's what I get for trusting the
                manual).
         *      Added the EGA/VGA display types, 720k, and 1.44 meg drives.
         *      Corrected stupid bugs in Hard Drive types.
         *      Corrected a bug with date setting; you can no longer set
                dates like 2/31/88 by starting with 5/31/88 and changing
                the month.
