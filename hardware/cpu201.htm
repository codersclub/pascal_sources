 Please read this file if you're new to the library.

 TMi0SDGL stands for Too-Much-in-0ne-So-Don't-Get-Lost and it's a comprehensive
 library for CPU and FPU detection on Intel-based PCs that comes in source code
 and free of charge. Please read the TMi0SDGL.DOC for license agreement and
 contact info as well as detailed information on the library.

 This file addresses some questions that may arise during first encounter with
 the library. You can skip it and proceed with the rest of the docs now, if
 you are already familiar with TMi0SDGL.


 1. What is TMi0SDGL?

 It is the most comprehensive CPU and FPU detection library I've seen to date
 (and I've seen many), it outperforms even commercial system information tools
 like TouchStone's CheckЭIt, Quarterdeck's Manifest, Norton SysInfo and
 similar. It correctly detects CPUs and FPUs that others don't, correctly
 detects their clock speed and advanced features and more. Another benefit of
 TMi0SDGL is that it's completely free for noncommercial use and is free for
 commercial use in some specific cases.

 2. Why TMi0SDGL?

 Well, why not? :) When I released the very first version over 3 years ago, I
 tried to find a good name for it, unlike those anonymous "cputype" things that
 were many in number and all alike. And when I assured that my version detects
 much more CPUs than any other I thought this is a bit "too much". Then came
 the name. The library detects much CPUs, too much, all in one package, so
 don't get lost in them. Now I don't think this is that good name for the
 library, but it spread wide since then and I decided not to change it.
 It's a bit hard to pronounce, but who cares spelling it if it's not a
 commercial product that have to have easy-spelling and mind-stamping name?

 3. What's in TMi0SDGL?

 Routines to detect over 30 different CPUs (over 50 with all the models and
 subtypes) and over 15 FPUs (see TMi0SDGL.DOC for complete list);
 Routine to detect all those CPUs' clock speed;
 Routine to detect L1 cache size for CPUs with internal cache;
 Routine to detect advanced features of Intel Pentium(tm), newer i486s and
 their clones from independant vendors (Cx5x86, AMD K6, etc.).
 Routine to detect current mode of operation (real or V86) for real mode
 programs.
 Supports real and protected mode for Pascal and C[++] compilers from Borland
 Intl. C version written in ANSI C and should compile with any other compiler
 from any other vendor (but you'll have to change command line options in
 makefiles...).
 Full source code included:
 Lots of good clean assembler with meaningful comments wherever possible;
 Functionally identical C and Pascal frontends to the assembler code;
 Example programs.

 Not enough? - write me back and I'll add new features on your request!

 4. Is it supported?

 No. Because this is not a commercial product, I do not provide any technical
 support for this library. But I always process letters from users and respond
 to all of them if reply is expected. Bugs are fixed ASAP, and all suggestions
 are taken in mind.

 5. What's good in it for me?

 It depends on you. If you're system programmer for x86 - you know what's good
 in it for you. If you're writing programs for x86 - you can add the TMi0SDGL
 functionality in your programs and show the users that you're tough one ;).
 You can enable/disable some features of your software depending on what type
 of CPU it's running on. You can simply stun the users telling them which CPU
 they have when other programs can't!
 Well, if none of above apply to you - you name what's good in it for you. If
 there's nothing good - it doesn't take much effort to delete the archive and
 all files you extracted from it...

 6. Thanks for reading this blah-blah and proceed to the rest of the docs.
    And I'm going to get me some coffee and burgers. 8-)
