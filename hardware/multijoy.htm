-----------------------------

We are talking about a great invention that adds a new dimension to PC gaming.
If you belong to the big group of people who always missed two player
games on the PC, let us tell you that the unhappy times are over. The
Multi Joystick Interface makes it possible to play games with not just
two, but with up to six players simultaneously. As you will discover, six
player games are even more fun than two player games. Dig out all your old
Atari or Commodore joysticks, as you will never need to worry about
malfunctioning analogue joysticks again.

To put it in more sober words:

The Multi Joystick Interface is a device that makes it possible to connect
up to six digital joysticks (Atari type) to the parallel port of your
PC. For test (or two player gaming) purposes, two joysticks can be
emulated by the keyboard, so you can try out the games before you
actually decide to build an interface.

In this software package, you find:

a) the description you need for building a multi joystick interface
b) test programs useful for checking your interface
c) Pascal and C routines you can use to develop software for the interface


Don't miss the games, they are not included in this package. You can
find them at

        ftp.tu-clausthal.de     /pub/msdos/games/multijoy

For those of you without ftp access, there is also a mail server. Just mail
a message with 'help' as body to

        mail-server@ftp.tu-clausthal.de

to see how it works.
