{ - The unit has been written with TP6.0 on an 386SX/IIT387SX machine        }
{ - The procedure MulM4V4 needs an IIT coprocessor                           }
{ - The 287 coprocessor needs additional FWAIT commands in of strategic      }
{   places all over the code, since I don't have one I didn't bother.        }
{ - All routines PUSH DS on entry, use long pointers (You don't want to      }
{   be limited to 64K won't You ?) for operand access and POP DS on exit     }
{ - No testing of the routines has been carried out except that they work    }
{   fine and fast in my application - NO WARRANTY !                          }
{ - I wrote the routines as I needed them (or as I wanted to find out how to }
{   do it, in the case of MulM4V4) but at least the Vector3 operations are   }
{   quite complete by now. If I find the time some more Matrix3 code may     }
