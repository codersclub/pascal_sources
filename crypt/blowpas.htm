                                 Version 1.1b

                               31 December 1994

Original  C  code  written  by  Bruce  Schneier,  translated to
Turbo  Pascal with some additional changes  by Walter van Holst
with some debugging help from  Erik Cumps. Since Bruce Schneier
placed the algorithm  in the public  domain this implementation
should be as well.

The additional changes are as following:

    - Left out the part of the key initialization routine which
      loaded a data file containing a random  seed, exactly the
      same random seed is included in an constant. This is done
      to make it easier to use this source for another compiler
      than Borland  Pascal or Turbo Pascal. In the case you are
      using this code on another  platform than MS-DOS and/or a
      compiler which is not compatible with Turbo Pascal you'll
      have to rewrite the F function entirely and should take a
      look at the InitBlowfish routine as well. Apart from this
      only the LongInt type variable might be platform/compiler
      dependent, the rest of this code is standard Pascal.

      However, you should outcomment  any reference to the i386
      asm code included with  this package. Since  Jeroen did a
      nice job in commenting his code, it should be easy for an
      experienced M68xxx  assembler programmer  to port it to a
      Motorola  platform, again  apart from  the little and big
      endian  story. I would strongly discourage any  effort to
      port anything of this to a  processor  unable to handle 32
      bits integers in one instruction.

    - The original source  code in C as published in Dr. Dobb's
      Journal of April 1994 used one variable containing the P-
      array  and another variable containing  the four S-boxes.
      In  this implementation  only the datatypes of  these two
      are defined. This enables the user to initialize multiple
      keys concurrently,  but requires  the calling routines to
      have the used variables defined themselves.

    - The three most used routines (the F function, BlowEncrypt
      BlowDecrypt)  are also implemented in TASM  thanks to the
      efforts of Jeroen Pluimers.  The optimization of the code
      resulted in a  performance increase of about 6000% If you
      use the compiler  directive $Define Include_Asm and  have
      all the .OBJ files in the right directory the performance
      should be at least 256 Kbit/s using an i386DX33 processor
      or better.

      The author of the Blowfish algorithm can be reached via the
      internet  as schneier@chinet.com, the authors of  this unit
      have the following Fidonet addresses:

                               Erik Cumps       2:292/608.24
                               Walter van.Holst 2:281/201.4
                               Jeroen Pluimers  2:281/256

      Thanks to John Lots for helping with the first steps to im-
      plement crucial parts in i386 assembler.</PRE>
