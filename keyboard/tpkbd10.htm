        If you are like me, you often write programs that use "special"
        keys like the arrow keys, function keys, etc., but the way these
        keys are implemented seems frustrating; first you have to read a
        null character, then do another read, and you have keep track of
        what code means what.  This detracts from the readability of the
        program and disrupts your flow of thought.  Or maybe you'd like
        to read numbers from the keyboard but not have to worry about
        trapping errors in input to avoid a fatal "Invalid numeric
        format" error or check to see if the number typed is in the range
        you want it.  Or maybe you'd like to have a better input routine
        than ReadLn to input a string.  This unit tackles all those
        problems, and a few others to enable you to write programs that
        contain clean, good-looking, error-free input.

        Whether or not you send a donation, any feedback you have on this
        unit is certainly welcome, and I will try to correct any bugs
        reported, although I think I have tested it thoroughly enough
        that almost all the bugs are gone (I have tested it quite
        extensively and used it in several programs of mine).  More than
        anything, I would like to hear how this unit works with unusual
        setups, like computers with keystroke buffer extenders or other
        such things.  I will gladly answer any questions as soon as I
        can.  If you have access to electronic mail, you can reach me
        faster at

          tswingle@oucsace.cs.ohiou.edu  or  swingle@duce.cs.ohiou.edu.

        This unit is still undergoing rigorous testing, and bug reports
        (if any, hopefully there are none) will be coming in as time goes
        by, so contact me to see if there have been any updates, if this
        unit interests you!</PRE>
