 This unit activates the IBM enhanced keyboard for machines that have one, and
 simulates an enhanced keyboard for machines that don't. The enhanced scan
 codes will be returned by all normal calls which read the keyboard, e.g,
 ReadKey (from CRT), ReadKeyWord (from TPCRT and supplied here), and even when
 DOS reads from the keyboard. This unit should be USEd early in a program's
 USES list. There are no procedures to call here -- operation is completely
 transparent to the program.

 The unit interfaces a variable, HasEnhancedKbd, which will be True if an
 enhanced keyboard was detected, False otherwise. It interfaces a second
 variable, EnableEnhanced, which defaults to true. If you set this variable to
 False, the ENHKBD special functions will be disabled until you set the
 variable to true again.

 The following table summarizes the keys which are affected by using this
 unit. The entries are the values of the scan word in hex. The high byte of
 the scan word is the scan code, the low byte the ASCII character. If the low
 byte is 00, the high byte will be returned on the next call to ReadKey. Any
 keys not listed are returned in the usual manner (see the Turbo Pascal 4.0
 manual, first printing pages 571-572, for a scan code chart). See Notes,
 following the table, for the key to special symbols.

Notes:
- These keystrokes are ignored.
* These keystrokes are not normally returned by the non-enhanced keyboard.
# These keystrokes are not normally returned by the enhanced keyboard.
! These keystrokes control printscreen and print echoing. They cannot
  simulate the effect of the enhanced keyboard, which has the Asterisk and
  PrtSc keys separated.
% The F11 and F12 keys are returned only if they actually exist on the
  keyboard.

 With a few exceptions, the EnhKbd unit returns results identical to those of
 the enhanced keyboard BIOS. One difference makes the enhanced keyboard
 simpler to use in a program: those scan words which normally contain E0 in
 the low byte to indicate that the key is specific to the enhanced keyboard
 (like the dedicated cursor keys) will have the low cleared to zero by EnhKbd.

 Keys marked with # are normally ignored by the enhanced BIOS. By defining
 these numeric keypad keys when Alt is pressed, the usual ability to enter
 arbitrary keys on the numeric keypad is disabled. Within applications, the
 ability to use alt-shifted arrow keys will generally be more useful. The
 arbitrary keys from the numeric keypad are still available by pressing both
 Alt and Left Shift simultaneously.

 Because this unit takes over interrupt 9, it will crash the system if
 SideKick is installed and another TSR that takes over interrupt 9 has been
 loaded after SideKick. You must exercise similar caution in using this unit
 in programs that must take over interrupt 9 for other reasons. If you have
 Turbo Professional, see SMACS.PAS for an example of implementing EnhKbd in a
 TSR.

 for pointing out problems in earlier versions.
