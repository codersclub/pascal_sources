<TR><TD colspan=3><PRE><p style="margin-left:50px">HOTMOD is a program that allows you to reassign the hot keys in the Integrated
Development Environment of Turbo Pascal 6.0.

To use HOTMOD:

1.  Compile the program to disk to create HOTMOD.EXE.  (You can compile to
    memory if you really want to.  Just remember that any hot key changes you
    make while in the IDE will not take effect until you exit to DOS and
    execute the modified TURBO.EXE.)

2.  Run HOTMOD in the same directory that contains your TURBO.EXE.

3.  HOTMOD displays a menu showing all hot key commands and their current
    key assignments.

4.  Using the cursor arrow keys, move the cursor to the hot key that you want
    to modify.

5.  Press the key that you want to use as the new hot key for the selected
    command.  The name of the new key will appear in place of the old
    assignment.  Only keys that return extended key codes are allowed.  These
    are listed in Appendix B, Table B.2 of the Turbo Pascal 6.0. Programmer's
    Guide.  If you press an invalid key, the program will beep.

    If you prefer, you can disable a hot key by pressing Ctrl-@.  Once a
    hot key has been disabled, that key is then available to be assigned
    to an editor function or macro by using Borland's TEMC program.

6.  Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you have made all desired changes.  When you
    are finished, press the Esc key.  If you have made any changes, HOTMOD
    displays the message

       Save changes to TURBO.EXE (Y/N) ?

    Type 'Y' if you want to save the changes, or 'N' if you want to ignore
    them.

HOTMOD attempts to change the hot key helps in the menus and on the status
line for any hot key you change.  This only works if the name of the new key
fits into the same number of characters as the old key.  For example "Alt-F10"
would fit into the space formerly used by "Ctrl-F1", but "Shift-F10" would not.
If the new key name does not fit, or the hot key function is disabled, HOTMOD
will substitute asterisks in place of the old key name.

If you have any comments, suggestions, or bug fixes for this program, please
contact Ron Schuster [76666,2322].</PRE>
